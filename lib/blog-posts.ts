    content: `# What Is Saju? The Korean Astrology System That Makes Western Zodiac Look Like a Toy

You know your zodiac sign. Maybe you're a Scorpio, a Gemini, or a Capricorn. But here's the thing — that puts you in the same bucket as roughly 600 million other people on Earth.

**Saju does something radically different.**

## The Basics: Four Pillars, Eight Characters

Saju (사주, literally "four pillars") is a system that has guided life decisions across Korea, China, and Japan for over a thousand years. It's also known as the **Four Pillars of Destiny** or by its Chinese name, Bazi (八字).

Instead of using just your birth month like Western astrology, Saju uses four data points:

- **Year Pillar** — your generation energy and relationship with society
- **Month Pillar** — your career tendencies and public persona  
- **Day Pillar** — your core self and romantic nature (this is your "Day Master")
- **Hour Pillar** — your inner world and legacy

Each pillar has two characters — a **Heavenly Stem** and an **Earthly Branch** — giving you eight characters total. That's where the Chinese name "Bazi" (eight characters) comes from.

## Why 518,400 Profiles?

The math is elegant. There are 60 possible Stem-Branch combinations (the "Sexagenary Cycle"), and four pillars to fill. But because the pillars are astronomically constrained, the realistic number of unique charts is **518,400**. Compare that to Western astrology's 12 types.

## The Five Elements

Everything in Saju maps to five cosmic forces: **Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water**. These aren't just labels — they describe how energy moves in your life:

- **Wood** — growth, creativity, expansion
- **Fire** — passion, visibility, action
- **Earth** — stability, nurturing, grounding
- **Metal** — precision, discipline, clarity
- **Water** — wisdom, adaptability, flow

The balance of these elements in your chart determines your personality, natural talents, relationship patterns, and even your health tendencies.

## Your Day Master: The Core of Who You Are

The Heavenly Stem on your Day Pillar is called your **Day Master** (일주, 日主). It's the single most important character in your chart — like your sun sign in Western astrology, but far more specific.

There are 10 possible Day Masters, each with a distinct personality signature. A Yang Wood person leads like a towering oak tree. A Yin Water person adapts like morning dew. Knowing your Day Master is the first step to understanding your Saju chart.

## How Is This Different from Western Astrology?

| Feature | Western Astrology | Saju |
|---------|------------------|------|
| Unique profiles | 12 | 518,400 |
| Data used | Birth month | Year + Month + Day + Hour |
| Time precision | None | True Solar Time from birth city |
| Forecasting | Monthly horoscopes | Year-by-year and day-by-day |
| System age | ~2,000 years | ~1,000+ years |

## Why People Are Discovering Saju Now

K-culture has brought Korean food, music, and drama to the world. Now it's bringing Korean wisdom. In Korea, Saju isn't considered "fortune telling" — it's a legitimate decision-making framework. Business executives consult Saju masters before major deals. Couples check their compatibility charts before marriage.

The difference is that Saju doesn't just tell you *who you are*. It tells you **when to act** — which years favor bold moves, which months to be cautious, and which relationships will challenge or support your growth.

## Try It Yourself

If you've ever felt that your zodiac horoscope was too generic — "Leos are confident leaders" — you're not alone. Millions of people share your exact sign. Saju offers something radically more personal.

## The Precision Gap

Western astrology divides humanity into **12 sun signs** based on birth month. Saju divides humanity into **518,400 unique profiles** based on birth year, month, day, and hour.

That's not a small difference. It's the difference between a blood type test and a full DNA sequence.

## What Saju Captures That Western Astrology Misses

**Birth hour matters.** Someone born at 3 AM has completely different Hour Pillar energy than someone born at 3 PM — even on the same day. Western astrology ignores this entirely (unless you go deep into natal chart calculations).

**True Solar Time.** Saju adjusts for your birth city's longitude, calculating the actual solar position at your birth moment. Born in Seoul vs. New York? Even at the same clock time, your chart is different.

**Element interactions.** Your five elements don't just sit there — they generate, control, and clash with each other in specific patterns that reveal relationship dynamics, career aptitudes, and health vulnerabilities.

## Where Western Astrology Wins

Western astrology has one major advantage: **cultural familiarity**. Everyone knows their zodiac sign. It's an instant conversation starter. Saju requires a bit more explanation — but the payoff is exponentially deeper insight.

## The Bottom Line

Western astrology tells you what month you were born. Saju tells you who you actually are, what you're built for, and when your best opportunities will arrive. Once you see your Four Pillars chart, your zodiac sign starts to feel like a rough sketch compared to a detailed portrait.`,

    content: `# The Five Elements Personality Guide

In Saju (Korean Four Pillars astrology), everything maps to five cosmic forces. These aren't just abstract concepts — they're the building blocks of your personality, the engine of your relationships, and the key to understanding your life patterns.

## Wood 木 — The Creator

**Personality:** Growth-oriented, creative, visionary. Wood people are natural planners who see the big picture. Like a tree, they grow steadily upward, branching into new ideas.

**Career strengths:** Education, writing, design, environmental science, startups, urban planning.

**In relationships:** Nurturing and expansive. They help their partners grow — sometimes to the point of neglecting their own needs.

**Health focus:** Liver, gallbladder, eyes, tendons. Wood people benefit from green vegetables and outdoor time.

## Fire 火 — The Performer

**Personality:** Passionate, charismatic, action-driven. Fire people light up any room. They're natural leaders who inspire others through sheer energy and enthusiasm.

**Career strengths:** Entertainment, marketing, public speaking, technology, restaurants, media.

**In relationships:** Intense and warm. They love deeply but can burn hot and fast. They need partners who can handle their intensity without being consumed by it.

**Health focus:** Heart, circulation, small intestine. Fire types should manage stress and avoid overstimulation.

## Earth 土 — The Anchor

**Personality:** Stable, trustworthy, practical. Earth people are the ones everyone leans on. They're natural mediators who bring harmony to chaotic situations.

**Career strengths:** Real estate, finance, HR, agriculture, counseling, construction.

**In relationships:** Loyal and grounding. They create safe spaces for their partners. Their challenge is avoiding stagnation — they sometimes stay in comfortable situations too long.

**Health focus:** Stomach, spleen, muscles. Earth types need regular meals and digestive care.

## Metal 金 — The Strategist

**Personality:** Precise, disciplined, principled. Metal people cut through confusion with clarity. They have strong values and high standards — for themselves and others.

**Career strengths:** Law, engineering, surgery, military, luxury goods, technology, accounting.

**In relationships:** Devoted but exacting. They show love through reliability and structure. Their challenge is flexibility — they can be rigid when situations call for adaptation.

**Health focus:** Lungs, skin, large intestine. Metal types benefit from breathing exercises and skincare routines.

## Water 水 — The Philosopher

**Personality:** Wise, adaptable, intuitive. Water people flow around obstacles rather than fighting them. They're natural diplomats and deep thinkers.

**Career strengths:** Research, academia, trading, logistics, travel, psychology, technology.

**In relationships:** Deeply empathetic but sometimes elusive. They understand their partners intuitively but can struggle with directness. They need emotional depth in their connections.

**Health focus:** Kidneys, bladder, bones, ears. Water types should stay hydrated and protect their lower back.

## Your Element Balance

Most people aren't just one element — your birth chart contains all five in varying proportions. The key is understanding which elements are dominant, which are weak, and how they interact.

When your elements are balanced, life flows naturally. When they're imbalanced, you experience the friction — in your career, relationships, or health — that drives you to seek answers.

    content: `# Your Day Master: The Most Important Character in Your Birth Chart

If you could know only one thing about your Saju chart, it should be your **Day Master** (일주, 日主). It's the Heavenly Stem sitting on your Day Pillar — and it defines the core of who you are.

Think of it as your elemental DNA. While your full chart has eight characters interacting in complex ways, your Day Master is the protagonist of the story.

## The 10 Day Masters

There are 10 Heavenly Stems, each combining an element with Yin or Yang polarity:

**Yang Wood (甲, 갑)** — The towering oak. Natural leaders with strong convictions. They stand tall and protect others but can be inflexible.

**Yin Wood (乙, 을)** — The vine. Flexible, adaptable, graceful. They find a way to grow around any obstacle, but can be indecisive.

**Yang Fire (丙, 병)** — The sun. Warm, generous, universally loved. They illuminate everything around them but can't hide their emotions.

**Yin Fire (丁, 정)** — The candle flame. Focused, intimate, romantic. They provide warmth to those close to them but can flicker under pressure.

**Yang Earth (戊, 무)** — The mountain. Massive, reliable, immovable. They're the people everyone trusts, but they can be stubborn beyond reason.

**Yin Earth (己, 기)** — The fertile field. Nurturing, productive, supportive. They help everything around them grow, sometimes at the cost of their own identity.

**Yang Metal (庚, 경)** — The sword. Sharp, decisive, fearless. They cut through problems with precision but can wound people unintentionally with their directness.

**Yin Metal (辛, 신)** — The jewel. Refined, beautiful, perfectionist. They have impeccable taste and standards but can be overly self-critical.

**Yang Water (壬, 임)** — The ocean. Vast, powerful, unstoppable. They're deep thinkers with endless capacity, but can overwhelm others with their intensity.

**Yin Water (癸, 계)** — The morning dew. Gentle, perceptive, quietly transformative. They notice what everyone else misses but can evaporate under too much heat.

## Why Your Day Master Matters

Your Day Master determines:
- **How you love** — each element expresses and receives love differently
- **What career suits you** — your natural working style and professional energy
- **Which people complement you** — element harmony in relationships
- **When to act** — certain years amplify your Day Master's strengths

## Beyond Just Your Day Master

Your Day Master is the starting point, not the full picture. How it interacts with the other seven characters in your chart creates the nuance — your unique pattern of strengths, challenges, and timing.

What if you could see the elemental chemistry between you and your partner — not through vague horoscope advice, but through the precise interaction of your birth charts?

## How Saju Compatibility Works

Saju compatibility (궁합, gung-hap) analyzes how two people's Four Pillars charts interact. It goes far beyond "Leos and Sagittarians are compatible" by examining:

**Day Master Harmony** — how your core elements relate. Some elements naturally support each other (Water nourishes Wood), while others create tension (Water controls Fire). Neither is inherently "good" or "bad" — it's about understanding the dynamic.

**Pillar Interactions** — your eight characters interact with their eight characters in 64 possible combinations. Hidden bonds (三合), clashes (沖), and harmonies (六合) reveal the deeper patterns of your connection.

**Element Balance** — does your partner's chart complement your element imbalances? The most harmonious partnerships often involve people whose charts naturally balance each other's weaknesses.

## What Our Free Compatibility Check Includes

- **Overall compatibility score** with detailed breakdown
- **Love & romance analysis** — attraction patterns, intimacy style, long-term dynamics
- **Work compatibility** — can you build something together?
- **Friendship dynamics** — the foundation beneath romance
- **Conflict resolution style** — how you fight and how you make up
- **This year's relationship forecast** — what the current energy means for your connection

All of this is **100% free**. No sign-up, no credit card, no catch.

## Why People Use Saju for Love Decisions

In Korea, checking compatibility charts before marriage is common practice — not as superstition, but as a framework for understanding relationship dynamics. It's the same reason Western couples do personality tests like MBTI or Enneagram, but with a thousand years of refinement.

The value isn't in "should we be together or not." It's in understanding **how** you're together — where the natural harmony flows, where the friction lives, and how to navigate both.

    content: `# 사주란 무엇인가?

"너 사주 봤어?" — 한국에서 이 질문은 일상입니다. 취업, 결혼, 이사, 창업 등 인생의 큰 결정 앞에서 사주를 참고하는 문화는 수천 년간 이어져 왔습니다.

## 사주(四柱)의 기본 구조

사주는 말 그대로 **네 개의 기둥**입니다. 태어난 **년, 월, 일, 시** 각각이 하나의 기둥이 되고, 각 기둥에는 **천간(天干)**과 **지지(地支)** 두 글자가 붙습니다. 총 8개의 글자 — 이것이 바로 **사주팔자(四柱八字)**입니다.

- **년주** — 조상과 사회적 관계
- **월주** — 직업과 사회적 활동
- **일주** — 나 자신과 배우자 (가장 중요!)
- **시주** — 자녀와 말년

## 왜 518,400가지인가?

천간 10개 × 지지 12개 = 60가지 조합(육십갑자). 이것이 네 기둥에 적용되면 천문학적 조합이 만들어집니다. 현실적으로 가능한 조합은 **518,400가지** — 서양 별자리 12가지와는 비교할 수 없는 정밀함입니다.

## 오행(五行) — 우주의 다섯 가지 에너지

사주의 핵심은 오행입니다:

- **목(木)** — 성장, 창의성, 새로운 시작
- **화(火)** — 열정, 활동력, 표현
- **토(土)** — 안정, 신뢰, 중재
- **금(金)** — 정밀함, 결단력, 원칙
- **수(水)** — 지혜, 적응력, 유연성

당신의 사주에 어떤 오행이 강하고 약한지에 따라 성격, 적성, 건강, 인간관계 패턴이 달라집니다.

## 일주(日主) — 나는 누구인가

일주 천간은 사주에서 **가장 중요한 한 글자**입니다. 이것이 바로 당신의 본질 — 갑목(甲木)이라면 큰 나무처럼 곧은 리더, 계수(癸水)라면 이슬처럼 섬세한 관찰자입니다.

10개의 일주 각각이 고유한 성격, 연애 스타일, 직업 적성을 가지고 있습니다.

## 서양 별자리와 무엇이 다른가?

서양 별자리는 태어난 **달**만 봅니다. 사주는 **년·월·일·시** 네 가지를 모두 보고, 출생 도시의 경도까지 반영한 진태양시(眞太陽時)로 계산합니다. 정밀도가 차원이 다릅니다.

"우리 궁합이 어때?" — 연애, 결혼, 사업 파트너까지, 두 사람의 관계를 사주로 분석하는 것이 궁합입니다.

## 궁합(宮合)이란?

궁합은 두 사람의 사주팔자를 비교하여 **오행의 조화, 일주의 관계, 합충의 유무**를 분석하는 것입니다. 단순히 "잘 맞다/안 맞다"가 아니라, 어떤 부분이 조화롭고 어떤 부분에서 갈등이 생기는지 구체적으로 알 수 있습니다.

## 오행 궁합의 원리

오행은 서로를 **생(生)**하거나 **극(克)**합니다:

- **상생(相生)**: 목→화→토→금→수→목 (서로 도움)
- **상극(相克)**: 목→토, 화→금, 토→수, 금→목, 수→화 (긴장과 도전)

상생 관계라면 자연스러운 지지, 상극 관계라면 성장을 위한 도전으로 해석합니다. 어느 쪽이든 "나쁜" 궁합은 없습니다 — 관계의 **역학**을 이해하는 것이 핵심입니다.

## 일주 궁합

두 사람의 일주(日柱)를 비교합니다. 천간의 합, 지지의 합·충·형이 궁합의 핵심 지표입니다.

## 무료로 궁합 확인하기

SajuAstrology에서는 두 사람의 생년월일을 입력하면 **100% 무료**로 상세한 궁합 분석을 제공합니다. 연애, 직장, 우정, 갈등 해결, 올해 전망까지 모두 포함됩니다.

四柱推命（しちゅうすいめい）は、東アジアで1,000年以上の歴史を持つ運命学です。生まれた**年・月・日・時**の4つの柱から、あなたの性格、才能、恋愛パターン、仕事の適性、健康傾向、そして人生の転機を読み解きます。

## 四柱八字の基本構造

四柱推命の「四柱」とは、文字通り**4つの柱**です：

- **年柱** — 祖先との関係、社会的な立場
- **月柱** — 仕事運、社会的な活動
- **日柱** — 自分自身と配偶者（最も重要！）
- **時柱** — 子供、晩年の運勢

各柱には**天干（てんかん）**と**地支（ちし）**の2文字があり、合計8文字 — これが**四柱八字**です。

## なぜ518,400通りなのか？

天干10種 × 地支12種 = 60通り（六十干支）。これが4つの柱に適用されると、現実的に可能な組み合わせは**518,400通り**。西洋占星術の12タイプとは比較にならない精密さです。

## 五行 — 宇宙の5つのエネルギー

四柱推命の核心は五行です：

- **木** — 成長、創造性、新しい始まり
- **火** — 情熱、行動力、表現
- **土** — 安定、信頼、調停
- **金** — 精密さ、決断力、原則
- **水** — 知恵、適応力、柔軟性

あなたの命式にどの五行が強く、どの五行が弱いかによって、性格・適性・健康・人間関係のパターンが変わります。

## 日主（にっしゅ）— あなたは誰か

日柱の天干は命式で**最も重要な一文字**です。甲木（きのえ）なら大木のような真っ直ぐなリーダー、癸水（みずのと）なら朝露のように繊細な観察者です。

## 西洋占星術との違い

西洋占星術は生まれた**月**だけを見ます。四柱推命は**年・月・日・時**の4つすべてを見て、出生地の経度まで反映した真太陽時で計算します。精密度が根本的に異なります。

「私たちの相性はどう？」— 恋愛、結婚、ビジネスパートナーまで、二人の関係を四柱推命で分析するのが相性診断です。

## 四柱推命の相性診断とは？

相性診断は、二人の四柱八字を比較して**五行の調和、日主の関係、合冲の有無**を分析するものです。単純に「合う・合わない」ではなく、どの部分が調和的でどの部分で葛藤が生まれるかを具体的に知ることができます。

## 五行相性の原理

五行は互いに**生（せい）**じたり**克（こく）**したりします：

- **相生**: 木→火→土→金→水→木（互いに助ける）
- **相克**: 木→土、火→金、土→水、金→木、水→火（緊張と挑戦）

相生関係なら自然な支え合い、相克関係なら成長のための挑戦と解釈します。どちらも「悪い」相性ではありません — 関係の**ダイナミクス**を理解することが核心です。

> **TL;DR**: Korean Saju (Four Pillars astrology) uses your exact birth time to map you to 1 of 518,400 unique profiles — 32,400× more precise than MBTI. SajuAstrology offers free Saju compatibility readings grounded in 562 classical passages, with true solar time correction.

You met them on Hinge. You both liked the same indie film. The first three dates felt electric. By month four, you're fighting about how they load the dishwasher and wondering why every relationship you've had follows the same arc — euphoria, friction, exhaustion, exit.

It's not random. And it's not just attachment style.

For five thousand years, scholars in Korea, China, and Japan have been recording a pattern that modern dating apps haven't begun to touch: **the moment you were born encodes a specific energetic signature that shapes how you connect, how you fight, and which kinds of partners will either complete you or quietly drain you over years.**

Western science is, finally, beginning to catch up. And the implications for your love life are bigger than any compatibility quiz Cosmo ever published.

## Quick Answer: What Is Saju Compatibility?

Saju compatibility — called *gunghap* in Korean and *aishou* in Japanese — is a Korean astrology system that analyzes how the Five Elements energy in two people's birth charts interact across multiple life dimensions. Unlike Western zodiac (12 sun signs) or MBTI (16 self-reported types), Saju uses your exact birth year, month, day, and hour to generate one of 518,400 unique profiles. The reading reveals where your relationship has natural chemistry, where friction will live, and which long-term cycles are aligning or clashing.

## The Science Tinder Hasn't Caught Up To Yet

Before we get to the Korean part, let's talk about what mainstream research has already confirmed about your birth moment.

Birth-season effects on personality and mental health are not fringe ideas anymore. Multiple peer-reviewed studies have shown that people born in winter months have measurably higher rates of certain psychological conditions, while those born in spring show different patterns of mood regulation. The leading hypotheses involve prenatal vitamin D exposure, maternal infection rates by season, and the photoperiod your developing nervous system is calibrated to in the first weeks of life.

Then there's the relative age effect. In Canadian professional hockey, roughly 40% of NHL players were born in the first three months of the year — because they were the oldest, biggest kids in their childhood leagues, got more coaching, more playing time, more confidence. A six-month head start at age seven compounds into a career.

These aren't horoscopes. These are statistical realities about how the timing of your arrival into the world shapes the trajectory of your life.

So when a five-thousand-year-old tradition tells you that the *exact hour* of your birth carries information about how you'll relate to other people — the question stops being "is this real?" and starts being "what specifically did they observe, and can it be tested?"

## Why Western Astrology Misses 99.99% of You

Here's the math nobody talks about.

Western zodiac sorts the entire human population into 12 sun signs. That means roughly 670 million people share your sign. Your "Sagittarius compatibility" applies to a group the size of the United States plus Mexico plus Canada combined.

Korean Saju — the Four Pillars system — works differently. It uses your birth year, month, day, and *hour*, each encoded as a pair of celestial markers (a Heavenly Stem and an Earthly Branch). The math works out to **518,400 unique profiles**.

That's 32,400 times more resolution than MBTI. Roughly 15,000 people on Earth share your full Saju chart. Not 670 million. Fifteen thousand.

When you ask "are we compatible?" through Western astrology, you're comparing two enormous demographic buckets. When you ask through Saju, you're comparing two near-individual fingerprints.

This is why people who try Saju for the first time often have the same reaction: "How did it know that?"

It's not magic. It's the math finally being granular enough to say something specific about *you*, not your continent.

## The Five Elements: How Korean Astrology Reads Relationship Chemistry

Saju doesn't think in "you're a Cancer, they're a Scorpio." It thinks in five elemental energies that flow through every birth chart in different proportions:

- **Wood (목)** — growth, vision, restless forward motion
- **Fire (화)** — passion, expression, performative warmth
- **Earth (토)** — grounding, loyalty, the friend who shows up
- **Metal (금)** — clarity, structure, the surgical edit
- **Water (수)** — wisdom, depth, the still pool nothing escapes

Every person carries some of all five, but in radically different ratios. Your dominant element shapes your default emotional vocabulary. Your weakest element is usually the thing you secretly crave in a partner — and the thing that'll drive you crazy if they have too much of it.

Here's the part that maps to relationships:

**Wood feeds Fire.** A vision-driven Wood-heavy person paired with an expressive Fire-heavy person creates fast-moving creative chemistry. They can build things together that neither could alone.

**Fire creates Earth.** Performative warmth eventually wants to ground itself in something stable. A Fire person often falls hard for an Earth person — and vice versa, because Earth people are quietly starved for warmth they don't have to manufacture themselves.

**Earth holds Metal.** Loyal stability provides the conditions for clear thinking. Earth-Metal pairings often look "boring" from the outside but produce remarkable creative output and emotional safety.

**Metal generates Water.** Sharp clarity, refined enough, becomes wisdom. Metal-Water people are often the partners everyone in their friend group calls during a crisis.

**Water nourishes Wood.** And the cycle closes. Deep wisdom feeds new growth.

This is the *generative* cycle. Pairs along this cycle tend to amplify each other.

But there's a *controlling* cycle too:

- Wood breaks Earth (the entrepreneur exhausts the loyalist)
- Earth blocks Water (the homebody resents the wanderer's depth)
- Water extinguishes Fire (the wise one quietly humiliates the performer)
- Fire melts Metal (the dramatic one shatters the editor's structure)
- Metal cuts Wood (the critic stops the visionary mid-sentence)

Most relationship friction has a clean Five Elements explanation. The fight you keep having about money? About clutter? About who "isn't trying"? It's almost always one element pressing on another in a way both people feel but neither can name.

## Why "80%" Is Not Hyperbole

Here's where I have to be honest with you about a number.

When the title of this post says your birthday decided 80% of your relationship patterns, that's not a peer-reviewed statistic. It's an editorial framing. What is true, and what Korean Saju practitioners have observed across centuries of recorded case studies, is this:

**The recurring patterns in your love life — the type of person you fall for, the type of fight you keep having, the type of breakup that always seems to find you — are far more predictable from your birth chart than from any other single variable about you.**

More predictable than your zodiac sign. More predictable than your MBTI. More predictable than your attachment style assessed in isolation.

Why? Because Saju isn't measuring a self-report. It's measuring a fixed, objective astronomical fact about the moment you arrived. You can lie on a personality test. You cannot lie about when you were born.

This is why Saju was used for marriage matching in Korea, China, and Japan for centuries. Not as superstition — as the closest thing pre-modern societies had to a personality compatibility instrument with built-in immunity to social desirability bias.

## What a Saju Compatibility Reading Actually Looks Like

A real Saju compatibility analysis (called *gunghap* in Korean, *aishou* in Japanese) doesn't just tell you "you're compatible" or "you're not." It tells you:

- **Where the chemistry is real.** Which elemental flows between your charts will create lasting attraction, and which will fade after the honeymoon.
- **Where the friction will live.** Which element from your partner's chart presses on which element of yours, and exactly which life domains (career decisions, family conflict, money, intimacy) that pressure will surface in.
- **What the timing looks like.** Saju maps long-term cycles called *daewoon* (great fortune cycles), each lasting roughly ten years. A couple may be entering their best alignment ever — or may be heading into a five-year stretch where they need extra patience. The reading tells you which.
- **What you each need to learn from the other.** This is the part that makes people cry. The element your partner is rich in is almost always the element your chart is hungry for. Long-term love, in the Saju view, is the work of metabolizing what the other person came to teach you.

When this is done well — with classical text grounding rather than vague "you're a fire sign" generalizations — the result feels less like a horoscope and more like therapy you didn't know you needed.

## The First Question to Ask Before You Get a Reading

If you're going to try a Saju compatibility reading — whether through us or anyone else — there's one question to ask the service first.

**"Do you correct for true solar time?"**

Your birth certificate says 2:00 PM. But the sun at 2:00 PM in Seoul is in a different position than the sun at 2:00 PM in Tokyo. Standard time zones are political conventions; the actual position of the sun over your birthplace is what determines your Hour Pillar. That correction can shift your entire chart.

Most cheap saju sites — and almost every English-language astrology calculator — skips this step. Their readings are calculated against a wrong sky. Don't bother with one that doesn't ask you for your birth city.

## The Quiet Trend Among People Who've Tried Everything

We've watched a specific pattern in our user data over the past few months. The people most likely to convert from a free Saju reading to a paid deeper analysis are not the people brand-new to astrology. They're the people who've already tried everything — Co-Star, MBTI, attachment style quizzes, even therapy — and noticed all of it was gesturing at something none of it could quite name.

They show up to Saju half-skeptical, half-exhausted. They run their chart. They run their partner's chart. And they message us things like "this is the first time I've seen the pattern I've been living inside described from the outside."

Whether you believe in destiny, or whether you believe ancient observers simply built a remarkably good instrument for measuring something modern psychology hasn't yet operationalized, the practical experience is the same: **you walk away understanding your relationship with more specificity than you walked in with.**

That's all we're claiming. Not magic. Not certainty. Specificity.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Korean Saju compatibility?

Korean Saju compatibility (called *gunghap* in Korean) is the analysis of how two people's Four Pillars birth charts interact across emotional, financial, and life-stage dimensions. It uses the Five Elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water) found in each person's birth year, month, day, and hour to map natural chemistry and predictable friction patterns.

### How accurate is Saju compared to MBTI or zodiac?

Saju has 518,400 unique profiles compared to MBTI's 16 and Western zodiac's 12 — 32,400 times more granular than MBTI. Because Saju uses your fixed birth time rather than self-report, the result never changes between sessions. MBTI re-test reliability is around 60%; Saju is 100% by definition.

### Is SajuAstrology really free?

Yes. SajuAstrology offers a genuinely free reading — no credit card, no trial, no signup wall mid-result. Compatibility analysis between two charts is also free. The deeper paid reading ($9.99 one-time) and master consultation ($29.99) are one-time payments and never auto-renew. Soram Companion ($4.99/month) is the only auto-renewable monthly subscription and you can cancel it anytime.

### What makes SajuAstrology different from other Korean astrology sites?

Three differences: (1) true solar time correction based on your birth city, which most sites skip; (2) every reading is generated in real time using a RAG pipeline grounded in 562 classical passages from five foundational Chinese-Korean astrology texts, not pre-written templates; (3) dual-LLM cross-verification (Gemini + Claude) for accuracy and 99.9% uptime.

### Can a Saju reading really predict relationship problems?

Saju identifies *patterns of friction* — specific points where two people's elemental energies will press against each other in predictable ways. It doesn't predict events. A "low compatibility" result doesn't mean you should leave the relationship; it means you'll exhaust each other if you don't see the pattern clearly. Couples who understand their friction often outlast couples with easy chemistry who never developed the skill.

### Do I need to know my exact birth time?

For the most accurate compatibility reading, yes — the Hour Pillar is one of four core data points. If you don't know your exact birth time, SajuAstrology can still generate a partial reading using year/month/day, but the depth of the relationship analysis improves significantly when both people's birth hours are available.

## Try It Free

Run your chart and your partner's chart in about thirty seconds. The reading is genuinely free — no credit card, no trial signup, no upsell wall in the middle. We correct for true solar time. We cite the classical passages we draw from. And we'll tell you, in plain English, where your chemistry lives and where your friction lives.

Whatever Tinder thinks it knows about you, this knows more.

## Quick Answer: How Does a Saju Compatibility Calculator Work?

A real Saju compatibility calculator takes both people's birth date, time, and city as input. It calculates each person's Four Pillars (eight characters representing the cosmic state at birth), maps them to Five Elements distributions, identifies each person's Day Master, then cross-references the two charts against five layers of classical analysis: elemental generation/control cycles, Day Master interactions, Branch combinations (harmonies and clashes), Useful Element alignment, and current Daewoon (10-year fortune cycle) phase. The output should be a structured map of where the relationship has natural energy and where it requires conscious effort — not a single score.

## What "Saju Compatibility" Is — In One Sentence

Saju compatibility — known as **gunghap (궁합)** in Korean and **aishou (相性)** in Japanese — is the analysis of how the Five Elements energy in two people's birth charts interact with each other across multiple life dimensions: emotional resonance, conflict patterns, financial alignment, sexual chemistry, and long-term life-stage timing.

That's it. That's the whole thing.

Everything else you read about gunghap is detail layered on top of that core idea. If a calculator gives you a single "compatibility score" out of 100 with no breakdown of *which* dimensions are strong and *which* are weak, you're looking at a toy, not a real reading.

## The 30-Second Process: What's Actually Happening Under the Hood

When you enter your birth date, time, and city into a real Saju compatibility calculator, here's what's happening in the background:

**Step 1 — Solar Time Correction.** Your civil clock time gets converted to true solar time based on the longitude of your birth city. Seoul, Busan, Tokyo, and Osaka are all in the same standard time zone but have meaningfully different solar offsets. This step alone changes the result for about 1 in 3 birth charts where the birth happened near a Pillar boundary.

**Step 2 — Four Pillars Calculation.** Your birth year, month, day, and hour each get assigned a Heavenly Stem (one of ten celestial markers) and an Earthly Branch (one of twelve). That's eight characters total — your Four Pillars, also called your Eight Characters (八字, *bazi*).

**Step 3 — Five Elements Mapping.** Each of those eight characters carries a Five Elements signature (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, or Water) plus a Yin or Yang polarity. Your full chart is now a weighted distribution across all five elements.

**Step 4 — Day Master Identification.** The Heavenly Stem of your Day Pillar is your Day Master — the elemental "you." This is the single most important data point in the entire chart. Everything else gets read in relation to it.

**Step 5 — Cross-Chart Synthesis.** When you and your partner's charts are placed side by side, the algorithm checks dozens of specific interactions: do your Day Masters generate or control each other? Do your weakest elements get supplied by your partner's strongest? Are there pillar combinations that classical texts flag as exceptionally harmonious or exceptionally difficult?

A serious Saju engine doesn't stop at "compatibility score." It produces a structured map of where your relationship has natural energy and where it'll need conscious effort.

## The Five Elements: A Crash Course That Makes the Result Readable

You can't read a compatibility report without understanding the Five Elements. Skim this section and you'll be ahead of most users.

**Wood (목 / 木).** Vision, growth, beginnings. Wood-heavy people are starters — they have ideas constantly, get bored once something is built, hate routine. In relationships they bring momentum but can exhaust partners who need stability.

**Fire (화 / 火).** Expression, charisma, visibility. Fire-heavy people perform — not in a fake way, but in the sense that they need to be seen, expressed, applauded. They make incredible early-stage romantic partners. They can struggle with quiet, undramatic phases.

**Earth (토 / 土).** Trust, loyalty, holding. Earth-heavy people are the friends everyone calls when their life falls apart. In relationships they bring extraordinary stability but can become resentful when they feel taken for granted, which they often are.

**Metal (금 / 金).** Clarity, refinement, judgment. Metal-heavy people see clearly and cut cleanly. They're the partners who'll tell you the hard truth nobody else will. They can be perceived as cold by people whose elements run hotter.

**Water (수 / 水).** Wisdom, depth, adaptability. Water-heavy people read situations the rest of the room can't. In relationships they're profound but sometimes hard to reach — they hold things back not from coldness but from depth.

Now here's the part that turns this into a compatibility tool.

## The Two Cycles That Decide Whether You're Compatible

Five Elements interact in two patterns. Once you know these, you can read any compatibility report meaningfully.

### The Generative Cycle (creates flow)

Wood → Fire → Earth → Metal → Water → Wood

Each element generates the next. When your dominant element generates your partner's dominant element (or vice versa), you have a *natural support* dynamic. Things flow. You feel like you're rooting for each other without effort.

### The Controlling Cycle (creates tension)

Wood → Earth → Water → Fire → Metal → Wood

Each element controls the one two steps ahead of it. When your dominant element controls your partner's, you have *natural friction*. This isn't necessarily bad — controlled tension can produce extraordinary growth — but it requires both people to understand what's happening or it turns into chronic conflict the couple can't name.

A real compatibility reading tells you which of these dynamics are active in your specific pairing, in which life domains, and what to do about it.

## The Six Compatibility Patterns Worth Knowing

Beyond the elemental cycle math, classical Saju texts identify specific *combinations* between Earthly Branches that have been observed across centuries. The most important for relationships:

**Six Harmonies (육합 / 六合).** Six specific Branch pairings that classical texts describe as exceptionally harmonious. When two people share a Six Harmony between their Day Pillars, the chemistry tends to be immediate, comfortable, and durable.

**Three Harmonies (삼합 / 三合).** Triangular combinations where three Branches reinforce each other. In couples, partial Three Harmony alignments often show up as "we just get each other" without the couple being able to articulate why.

**Six Clashes (육충 / 六沖).** Direct opposition pairings. These produce energy — sometimes magnetic attraction — but also recurring confrontation. Many couples with a Day Pillar Clash report they fight more than other couples but also find each other more interesting.

**Punishments (형 / 刑).** Combinations that classical texts mark as creating internal pressure. These are the patterns to be aware of, not afraid of — they often surface as unconscious power struggles around control and decision-making.

**Harms (해 / 害).** Subtle obstruction patterns. Harms tend to show up as lingering small resentments rather than dramatic conflict.

**Destructions (파 / 破).** Disruptive interactions, often felt as instability in the relationship's external circumstances (housing, jobs, family situations) more than between the people themselves.

A reading that doesn't engage with these patterns is a reading that's only working on 20% of the available information.

## How to Read Your Own Compatibility Report

When you get your result back, here's the order to read it in:

**1. Day Master interaction.** Look at how your Day Master relates to your partner's. Generative cycle, controlling cycle, identical, or unrelated? This is the headline of your relationship dynamic.

**2. Element balance.** Where is your chart strong, where is your partner's chart strong? Look for *complementarity* — does your weakness get fed by their strength? That's where long-term love often lives.

**3. Branch combinations.** Scan for any Six Harmonies, Three Harmonies, Clashes, or other combinations. Each one is information about a specific dynamic.

**4. Useful Element alignment.** A more advanced concept: each chart has a "Useful Element" (용신 / 用神) that the chart is hungry for. When your partner's strong element is your Useful Element, you experience them as nourishing in a way that's hard to put into words. This is the rarest and most powerful form of compatibility.

**5. Timing layer.** The best readings include where you both currently are in your ten-year cycles (대운 / *daewoon*). Two compatible people in clashing cycles will struggle for a few years. Two less-compatible people in synchronized cycles can have an unexpectedly easy stretch.

If your reading covers all five layers, you're working with a serious tool. If it gives you "you're 87% compatible, you'll have a happy marriage!", you're working with a fortune-cookie generator.

## What Compatibility Doesn't Mean

This is the most important paragraph in this article, so read it twice.

**A "low compatibility" Saju reading does not mean you should not be with this person.** It means: there are specific friction patterns in your pairing that, if you don't see them clearly, will exhaust both of you over time. Couples with challenging compatibility who *understand* their pattern often outlast couples with easy compatibility who never had to develop relationship skill.

**A "high compatibility" Saju reading does not mean the relationship will be easy.** It means: the natural chemistry is strong, but every relationship still requires the work of being two whole people sharing a life.

The reading is information. The decisions are yours. Anyone who tells you otherwise is selling you something other than astrology.

## What to Look For in a Saju Compatibility Service

Three checks before you trust a reading:

**Does it ask for birth city?** If not, it's not doing solar time correction. Skip it.

**Does it cite classical sources?** Saju has a 2,000-year textual tradition. A real reading should be traceable back to specific classical passages from texts like 子平真詮, 滴天髓, 窮通寶鑑, or 淵海子平. If a service hides its sources, it has none.

**Does it explain *why* — not just *what*?** "You're not compatible" is not a reading. "Your Day Master is Yang Fire and your partner's Day Master is Yang Water, which creates a controlling dynamic that will surface as conflict around long-term planning, but is offset by a Six Harmony in your Month Pillars that produces unusual emotional safety" — *that's* a reading.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the best free Saju compatibility calculator?

A serious Saju compatibility calculator should: (1) ask for birth city to apply true solar time correction, (2) analyze all five layers (Day Master, Five Elements, Branch combinations, Useful Element, Daewoon timing), and (3) cite classical sources. SajuAstrology.com offers all three free, with no credit card required and no signup wall.

### How long does a Saju compatibility reading take?

A modern AI-powered Saju compatibility reading takes about 30 seconds end-to-end. Traditional human readings by a master practitioner can take 1-2 hours. The accuracy of the underlying calculation is identical — the difference is in interpretation depth and personalization.

### Can Saju compatibility predict marriage success?

Saju compatibility identifies structural patterns in how two people's elemental energies interact, including patterns classical texts associate with marital harmony or difficulty. It does not predict events with certainty. Marriage success depends on both people's understanding of their patterns plus the conscious work they do — a "challenging" Saju compatibility doesn't doom a marriage, and an "ideal" compatibility doesn't guarantee one.

### What's the difference between gunghap and aishou?

*Gunghap* (궁합) is the Korean term and *aishou* (相性) is the Japanese term, but both refer to the same Four Pillars compatibility analysis system. The underlying calculation methodology is shared across Korean, Chinese, and Japanese traditions, with minor regional variations in interpretation emphasis. SajuAstrology applies the Korean methodology with multilingual interpretation.

### Do I need my partner's exact birth time?

For the deepest compatibility analysis, yes — both Hour Pillars are needed. If your partner's exact birth time is unknown, SajuAstrology can still generate a meaningful reading from year/month/day data, though the timing-related insights (Hour Pillar interactions, Daewoon precision) will be less specific.

### Is Saju the same as Chinese Bazi or Japanese Shichusuimei?

The three systems share the same core mathematical framework — Four Pillars based on Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches. They differ in interpretive emphasis: Korean Saju often focuses heavily on Useful Element analysis, Chinese Bazi places strong emphasis on structural patterns called *gé jú* (格局), and Japanese Shichusuimei integrates closely with Buddhist and Shinto cosmology. SajuAstrology uses the Korean methodology with multilingual interpretation.

## Try a Real One

If you want to see what a properly calculated Saju compatibility reading looks like — with true solar time correction, Five Elements analysis, classical text grounding, and an actual breakdown of where your chemistry and friction live — run yours and your partner's birth data through our free reading. It takes about thirty seconds. We don't ask for a credit card. We don't gate the result behind a signup wall. And we'll tell you what the chart actually says, in language a normal person can read.

Five thousand years of observation, summarized for the relationship you're in right now.

    content: `# MBTI에 지친 MZ세대가 다시 사주 궁합을 보는 이유 — 별자리보다 32,400배 정확한 한국식 매칭법

> **TL;DR**: 사주는 생년월일시로 518,400가지 유형을 만든다 — MBTI(16개)의 32,400배 해상도. SajuAstrology는 진태양시 보정과 562개 고전 구절 인용으로 무료 사주 궁합을 제공한다.

요즘 친구 모임에서 누가 새로 사람 만난다고 하면 대화가 자연스럽게 이쪽으로 흘러간다. "MBTI 뭐야?" 물어본 다음, 곧이어 "근데 사주는 봤어?" 한 번 더 묻는다. 점집 가는 게 어른들 일이었던 시대는 이미 지났다. 이십대 초반 카페에서 노트북 펴놓고 무료 사주 사이트 돌리는 게 더 흔한 풍경이 됐다.

이게 그냥 트렌드가 아닌 이유, 그리고 별자리나 MBTI로는 도달할 수 없는 정밀도가 사주 궁합에 있는 이유, 그리고 너의 궁합을 제대로 보는 법까지 — 이 글에서 다 풀어준다.

## 핵심 답변: 사주 궁합이란 무엇인가

사주 궁합은 두 사람의 사주(년주·월주·일주·시주) 안에 들어있는 오행(목·화·토·금·수)이 서로 어떻게 작용하는지를 분석하는 한국식 관계 진단 체계다. 별자리(12개)나 MBTI(16개)와 달리 **518,400개의 고유 유형**을 구분하며, 자기보고가 아니라 출생 시점이라는 객관적 사실을 사용한다. SajuAstrology에서 무료로 진태양시 보정과 5개 고전 원전 인용을 포함한 사주 궁합을 받을 수 있다.

## MBTI는 왜 지치게 되는가

MBTI가 한국 청년 사이에 번진 게 2020년 전후다. 5년 정도 지나고 나니 이제 한계가 보이기 시작했다.

**문제 1 — 16개는 너무 적다.** 8천만 한국인이 16개 그룹으로 나뉜다는 건, 한 그룹당 500만 명이 같은 유형이라는 소리다. 그 안에서 너랑 비슷한 사람이 진짜로 너랑 잘 맞을지는 별개 문제다.

**문제 2 — 자기보고식이라 기분 따라 바뀐다.** 같은 사람이 한 달 후에 다시 검사하면 결과가 바뀌는 비율이 약 40%다. 너 자신을 잘 모르는 상태에서 답한 결과로 너의 본질을 정의한다는 건, 사실상 거울 보고 거울을 그리는 셈이다.

**문제 3 — "T랑 F는 안 맞아" 같은 단순화가 공허하다.** ENTP끼리 결혼해서 평생 잘 사는 커플도 있고, 같은 INFJ인데 서로 죽일듯이 싸우는 커플도 있다. 16유형 매칭표는 마음의 안정을 주는 의식 같은 거지, 진짜 인간관계를 설명해주지 않는다.

이 한계가 명확해지면서 사람들이 다시 사주로 돌아오고 있다.

## 사주 궁합이 가진 압도적 정밀도

같은 질문에 답해야 한다 — "나는 누구인가, 우리는 잘 맞는가." 그런데 사주는 완전히 다른 방식으로 답을 만든다.

**년주, 월주, 일주, 시주.** 너의 출생 연·월·일·시 각각이 천간(天干, 10개) × 지지(地支, 12개) 조합으로 표현된다. 4개 기둥, 8개 글자. 가능한 조합은 **518,400개**다.

MBTI보다 32,400배 더 세밀하게 사람을 구분한다는 뜻이다. 같은 사주를 가진 사람이 지구상에 약 15,000명 있다. 한국으로 좁히면 수백 명 수준. MBTI 같은 그룹 500만 명에 비하면 사실상 너만의 지문이다.

그리고 — 이 부분이 핵심이다 — **사주는 자기보고가 아니다.** 너의 기분, 자기인식, 그날의 컨디션과 무관하게 출생 시점은 고정된 사실이다. 거짓말할 수 없다. 다시 검사해도 결과가 바뀌지 않는다.

## "근데 그게 진짜 맞아?" — 현대 과학이 말해주는 것

사주가 비과학이라는 인식이 있는데, 사실 출생 시점이 사람의 평생에 영향을 준다는 건 현대 통계학과 의학이 이미 인정한 사실이다.

**출생 계절 효과.** 겨울 출생자의 조현병 발병률이 봄·여름 출생자보다 5~8% 높다. 봄 출생자의 우울증 경향이 다른 계절보다 통계적으로 유의미하게 높다. 원인은 태아기 비타민D 노출량, 모체 감염률 차이, 출생 직후 광주기가 시상하부 생체리듬을 세팅하는 시점의 차이 등이다.

**상대연령 효과.** 캐나다 NHL 프로 하키 선수의 약 40%가 1~3월 출생이다. 어릴 때 같은 학년 친구들 중 가장 큰 아이였기 때문에 더 많이 뽑히고, 더 많이 훈련받고, 더 많은 자신감을 갖게 됐다는 통계다.

이런 현대 연구가 말하는 핵심은 단순하다 — **너의 출생 시점은 무작위가 아니라 의미 있는 변수다.** 동아시아 학자들은 이 변수를 5,000년간 다른 언어로 관찰하고 기록해왔다. 그게 사주다.

## 사주 궁합 — 진짜 보는 법

대부분의 무료 사주 사이트가 보여주는 "궁합 점수 87점!" 같은 결과는 사실 무의미하다. 진짜 사주 궁합은 점수가 아니라 **구조**를 본다. 다음 다섯 가지를 살펴봐야 한다.

### 1. 일간(日干) 관계 — 핵심 중의 핵심

일주의 천간을 일간이라고 부르는데, 이게 너의 본질을 나타내는 가장 중요한 글자다. 너의 일간과 상대의 일간이 어떻게 만나는지가 궁합의 헤드라인이다.

- **상생(相生) 관계**: 한쪽 일간이 다른 쪽을 생해줄 때. 자연스럽게 서로 응원하게 되는 흐름이 생긴다.
- **상극(相剋) 관계**: 한쪽이 다른 쪽을 극할 때. 긴장감이 생긴다. 좋은 의미의 자극일 수도 있고, 만성적 갈등으로 굳을 수도 있다.
- **비견(比肩) 관계**: 일간이 같은 오행일 때. 서로 너무 잘 알아서 편한 동시에, 자존심 부딪치면 끝까지 안 굽힌다.

### 2. 오행 균형 — 보완의 가능성

각자의 사주 안에 목·화·토·금·수 오행이 어떤 비율로 들어있는지 본다. 진짜 잘 맞는 궁합은 **너의 부족함을 상대가 채워주는** 구조다. 너에게 부족한 오행이 상대에게 풍부할 때, 그 사람을 만나면 평생 모르고 살았던 어떤 부분이 살아난다고 느낀다.

이걸 사주에서는 **용신(用神) 관계**라고 부른다. 가장 보기 드물지만 가장 강력한 형태의 궁합이다.

### 3. 지지 합충 — 만남의 화학반응

지지(地支)들 사이의 결합과 충돌도 본다.

- **육합(六合)**: 6가지 특정 지지 조합이 만나면 자연스러운 화합이 생긴다. 일지(日支)에 육합이 있는 커플은 첫 만남부터 편하다.
- **삼합(三合)**: 세 지지가 삼각형으로 결합하는 패턴. 부분 삼합만 있어도 "이 사람은 이상하게 마음이 통해" 하는 느낌이 든다.
- **육충(六沖)**: 정반대 지지가 부딪치면 충(沖)이라고 한다. 자극이 강하다. 어떤 커플은 충 때문에 끌리고, 어떤 커플은 충 때문에 끝낸다.
- **형(刑), 해(害), 파(破)**: 미묘한 압박, 작은 손상, 외부 환경의 불안정 — 각각 다른 종류의 약한 부조화 패턴이다.

### 4. 대운(大運) 시기 — 타이밍의 문제

사주는 정적인 차트가 아니다. 10년 단위로 흘러가는 **대운**이 있어서, 같은 사람이라도 이 10년과 다음 10년의 운세 흐름이 다르다.

너랑 상대가 각자 어떤 대운에 있느냐에 따라 같은 궁합도 다르게 작동한다. 두 사람이 모두 좋은 대운일 때 만나면 평생 갈 만한 관계가 되고, 한쪽이 어려운 대운일 때 만나면 같은 궁합이라도 무너지기 쉽다.

### 5. 진태양시 보정 — 안 하면 다 무용지물

이건 기술적인 부분인데 결정적이다. 너의 출생증명서엔 "오후 2시"라고 적혀있을 수 있지만, 한국 표준시는 일본 도쿄 자오선을 기준으로 한다. 서울에서의 실제 태양 위치는 표준시보다 약 32분 늦다. 이걸 보정하지 않으면 시주(時柱)가 바뀔 수 있고, 그러면 사주 전체가 달라진다.

**출생 도시를 묻지 않는 사주 사이트는 진태양시 보정을 안 하는 사이트다.** 결과가 기술적으로 틀렸을 가능성이 높다는 뜻이다.

## 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)

### 사주 궁합이 MBTI 궁합보다 정확한가?

사주는 518,400가지 유형을 구분하지만 MBTI는 16가지밖에 없다. 32,400배의 해상도 차이다. 또한 MBTI는 자기보고식 설문이라 검사 시점의 컨디션에 따라 결과가 바뀌지만, 사주는 고정된 출생 시점을 사용하므로 결과가 변하지 않는다. 정밀도와 일관성 모두 사주가 우위에 있다.

### 무료 사주 궁합 사이트 중 어디가 가장 정확한가?

정확한 사주 궁합 사이트는 세 가지 조건을 갖춰야 한다: (1) 진태양시 보정을 위해 출생 도시를 묻는다, (2) 점수 하나가 아니라 일간·오행·합충·용신·대운 5단계 구조 분석을 제공한다, (3) 고전 출처를 인용한다. SajuAstrology.com은 이 세 가지를 모두 무료로 제공하며, 신용카드 입력이나 회원가입을 요구하지 않는다.

### SajuAstrology는 정말 무료인가?

기본 사주 궁합 분석은 완전 무료다. 신용카드 입력 없이, 트라이얼 없이, 결과 중간에 결제창 없이 바로 받아볼 수 있다. 더 깊이 있는 유료 분석($9.99 1회 결제)과 마스터 컨설테이션($29.99)은 별도로 있지만, 기본 궁합과 사주 분석은 영구 무료다.

### 사주 궁합 결과가 안 좋으면 헤어져야 하나?

아니다. "궁합이 낮다"는 결과는 "두 사람 사이에 특정한 마찰 패턴이 있다"는 의미이지, "헤어져야 한다"는 의미가 아니다. 어려운 궁합인데도 그 패턴을 **이해하고 있는 커플**이, 쉬운 궁합이라 관계 기술을 키울 필요가 없었던 커플보다 오래 가는 경우가 많다. 사주 궁합은 정보이고, 결정은 본인 몫이다.

### 사주 궁합 보려면 시간을 정확히 알아야 하나?

가장 정확한 분석을 위해선 그렇다. 시주(時柱)는 사주 4기둥 중 하나라서 빠지면 분석 깊이가 떨어진다. 다만 출생 시간을 모르더라도 SajuAstrology에서 연·월·일만으로도 의미 있는 궁합 분석을 제공한다. 시간 관련 인사이트(시주 상호작용, 대운 정밀도)만 다소 덜 구체적이게 된다.

### 사주와 일본 시추스이메이, 중국 명리는 같은가?

세 체계 모두 천간·지지 기반 사주(四柱) 계산이라는 동일한 수학적 틀을 공유한다. 다만 해석 강조점이 다르다 — 한국 사주는 용신 분석을 중시하고, 중국 명리는 격국(格局) 구조 분석에 비중을 두며, 일본 시추스이메이는 불교·신토 우주관과 결합된다. SajuAstrology는 한국식 방법론을 다국어로 제공한다.

## 무료 궁합 보기 — 30초면 끝난다

너랑 상대의 생년월일시만 있으면 30초 안에 사주 궁합 결과를 받아볼 수 있다. 우리는:

- **진태양시 보정**을 한다 (그래서 출생 도시를 물어본다)
- **5개 고전 원전(자평진전, 적천수, 궁통보감, 연해자평, 격국용신)에서 562개 핵심 구절을 벡터화**해서 너의 차트에 매칭한다
- 결과는 점수 하나가 아니라 **구조적 분석** — 어디서 합이 좋고, 어디서 마찰이 있고, 어떤 영역에서 서로를 보완하고, 어떤 시기에 더 신경 써야 하는지 다 나온다
- **무료다.** 신용카드 안 묻고, 트라이얼도 없고, 중간에 결제창도 안 뜬다

MBTI로는 못 본 너의 패턴, 별자리로는 손가락 사이로 빠져나가던 그 디테일을, 5,000년 동안 누군가가 이미 관찰해서 정리해놨다.

이번엔 진짜로 한 번 봐라. 30초면 된다.

「四柱推命の相性って実際どうなの?」「西洋占星術や星座占いと何が違うの?」

最近、韓国カルチャーへの関心の高まりと共に、韓国式の四柱推命(韓国では「사주 / Saju」と呼ばれる)で相性を見る人が日本でも急速に増えています。SNSでは「サジュ相性診断」「韓国式相性占い」というキーワードの検索数が前年比で大幅に伸びています。

ただ — そのほとんどが、**本物の四柱推命相性診断とは別物**です。点数が一つ出てきて「あなたたちは87点の相性です!」で終わるものは、ほぼ全て自動生成された雛形に過ぎません。

この記事では、本物の四柱推命相性診断が何を見ているのか、なぜ西洋占星術より圧倒的に精密なのか、そして自分の相性を本当の意味で読み解く方法を、上から順に解説していきます。

## 答え:韓国式四柱推命の相性診断とは何か

韓国式四柱推命の相性診断(韓国語で「궁합 / クンハプ」、日本語で「相性 / アイショウ」)は、二人の生年月日時から計算された命式(年柱・月柱・日柱・時柱)に含まれる五行(木・火・土・金・水)が互いにどう作用するかを5つの層で分析する体系です。西洋占星術(12星座)やMBTI(16タイプ)と異なり**518,400通りの固有命式**を区別し、自己申告ではなく客観的な出生時刻を基にします。SajuAstrologyでは真太陽時補正と古典5原典の引用を含む相性診断を無料で提供しています。

## 四柱推命の相性が「518,400倍」精密と言われる根拠

まず数字の話から。

西洋占星術は人類全体を**12星座**に分類します。世界人口を12で割ると、あなたの星座は約6億7千万人と共有していることになります。「あなたは射手座だから〜」という分析は、アメリカとカナダとメキシコを合わせた人口に同じことを言っているのと同じです。

四柱推命は違います。生年・月・日・**時刻**まで使い、それぞれを天干(10種)と地支(12種)の組み合わせで表現します。年柱・月柱・日柱・時柱 — 4本の柱、合計8文字。可能な組み合わせは:

**518,400通り**

つまり四柱推命の解像度は、星座占いの**約43,200倍**、MBTIの**32,400倍**です。あなたと完全に同じ命式を持つ人は、地球上に約15,000人。日本国内に絞れば数十人程度です。事実上、あなた個人の指紋に近いレベルの精度です。

## なぜ「日本の四柱推命」と「韓国の四柱推命」が違うのか

日本にも四柱推命の伝統はあります。ただし、韓国式(사주)と日本の伝統的な四柱推命には、実は重要な違いがいくつかあります。

**第一に、用神(ようじん)重視の度合い**。韓国の四柱推命は、命式全体のバランスを取るために必要な「用神」を見極めることに極めて重きを置きます。これは命主が必要としている五行を特定する作業で、相性診断においても「相手があなたの用神を持っているか」が最重要ポイントの一つです。

**第二に、現代化の度合い**。韓国では1990年代以降、四柱推命の体系化と現代的解釈の研究が活発で、現代心理学やライフコーチング的な文脈との接続が進んでいます。日本の四柱推命がやや伝統色を強く保っているのと対照的です。

**第三に、AI/データサイエンスとの統合**。韓国のテック業界では、四柱推命の古典562節をベクトル化してRAG(検索拡張生成)パイプラインで個人の命式と照合する技術が実用段階に入っています。本記事の運営元であるSajuAstrologyもこの技術で動いています。これは日本ではまだほぼ見られない取り組みです。

## 相性診断 — 韓国式四柱推命では何を見るのか

「相性が良い・悪い」という二元論ではありません。本物の韓国式相性診断では、最低でも以下の5つの層を分析します。

### 1. 日干(にっかん)の関係 — 最重要

日柱の天干、つまり「日干」があなた自身の本質を表す最も重要な文字です。あなたの日干と相手の日干がどう交わるか — これが相性の見出しです。

**相生(そうしょう)関係**: 一方の日干が他方を生み出す関係。例えば木が火を生む、火が土を生むという五行の流れ。自然と互いを支え合う関係になります。

**相剋(そうこく)関係**: 一方が他方を制する関係。例えば金が木を切る、水が火を消すという関係。緊張感のある関係です。良い意味の刺激にもなり得るし、慢性的な葛藤に固定化することもあります。

**比肩(ひけん)関係**: 日干が同じ五行同士。お互いを深く理解できる反面、譲らない時はお互い譲らないため、摩擦も生まれやすい関係です。

### 2. 五行のバランス — 補完性の発見

それぞれの命式に含まれる**木・火・土・金・水**の五行が、どんな比率で入っているかを見ます。

本当に長く続く相性の核心は、**あなたに足りない五行を相手が豊富に持っている**ことです。あなたに不足している五行を相手が補ってくれる時、その人と一緒にいると「自分の中で眠っていた何かが目を覚ます」感覚を得ます。

これを四柱推命では**用神関係**と呼びます。最も希少で、最も強力な相性パターンです。

### 3. 地支の合冲(ごうちゅう) — 化学反応のパターン

地支(ちし)同士の結合と衝突のパターンも見ます。

**六合(りくごう)**: 6つの特定の地支ペアが特別に調和する組み合わせ。日支に六合がある二人は、初対面から不思議な居心地の良さを感じることが多いです。

**三合(さんごう)**: 3つの地支が三角形状に強く結びつくパターン。部分三合だけでも「この人とは何故か通じる」という感覚を生みます。

**六冲(りくちゅう)**: 真逆の地支がぶつかる組み合わせ。刺激が強い。冲があるカップルは、冲のせいで惹かれる場合と、冲のせいで別れる場合が両方あります。どちらに転ぶかは、その人たちが冲をどう扱うかで決まります。

**刑(けい)・害(がい)・破(は)**: それぞれ別種の弱い不調和パターン。微細な圧迫、小さな損傷、外部環境の不安定として現れます。

### 4. 大運(たいうん) — タイミングの問題

四柱推命は静的な命式ではありません。10年単位で流れる**大運**があり、同じ人でもこの10年と次の10年では運気の質が変わります。

二人の大運がどのフェーズにあるかで、同じ相性でも作用の仕方が変わります。両方が良い大運期にある二人が出会えば、長く続く関係になりやすい。片方が困難な大運期に出会うと、同じ相性でも崩れやすい。タイミングは想像以上に重要です。

### 5. 真太陽時補正 — これがないと全部無意味

技術的な話ですが、決定的に重要な部分です。

あなたの出生証明書には「午後2時」と書かれているかもしれません。しかし日本標準時は東京の経度を基準にしていて、北海道や九州、沖縄では実際の太陽位置と数十分の差があります。これを補正しないと**時柱**が変わってしまい、命式全体が別物になります。

**出生地(都市名)を聞かない四柱推命サイトは、真太陽時補正をしていないサイト**です。技術的に間違った命式で相性を見ている可能性が高いということです。

## 「相性が悪い」という結果の本当の意味

ここが一番大事なので、太字にします。

**「相性が低い」という結果は「別れた方がいい」という意味ではありません。**

それは「あなたたちの間には、見えないままにしておくとお互いを消耗させる特定の摩擦パターンが存在する」という意味です。難しい相性のカップルでも、自分たちのパターンを**理解している**カップルは、簡単な相性で楽さに甘えて関係スキルを磨かなかったカップルより長く続くことが多いです。

そして — **「相性が良い」という結果も「楽な恋愛になる」という意味ではありません。**

それは「自然な化学反応は強い」という意味で、それでも相性の良いカップルもまた、二人の人間が一つの人生を共有するという仕事をする必要があります。

相性診断は**情報**です。決断はあなたのものです。

## 韓国式四柱推命の相性診断 — 信頼できる本物の見分け方

相性診断サービスを選ぶ前のチェック項目を3つ:

**出生都市を聞いてくるか?** 聞かないなら真太陽時補正をしていません。スキップしましょう。

**古典の出典を引用しているか?** 四柱推命には2,000年の文献的伝統があります。本物の相性診断は、子平真詮、滴天髓、窮通宝鑑、淵海子平など、特定の古典の節に遡れる根拠を持っているはずです。出典を隠すサービスは、出典を持っていません。

**「なぜそうなるのか」を説明しているか?** 「あなたたちは合いません」は診断ではありません。「あなたの日干は陽火、相手の日干は陽水で相剋関係にあり、長期計画の領域で衝突が出やすい一方、月柱に六合があるため感情的安定感は強い」 — これが診断です。

## よくある質問(FAQ)

### 韓国式四柱推命と日本の四柱推命は何が違いますか?

両者は同じ天干・地支体系を共有しますが、解釈の重点が異なります。韓国式は用神(命式が必要としている五行)分析を最重要視し、現代心理学的な解釈との統合が進んでいます。日本の四柱推命は伝統的な格局論を重視する傾向があります。SajuAstrologyは韓国式方法論を10ヶ国語で提供しています。

### 相性診断は無料で本当に正確に受けられますか?

はい、信頼できる無料の相性診断は3つの条件を満たすべきです:(1)真太陽時補正のため出生都市を聞く、(2)点数ではなく日干・五行・合冲・用神・大運の5層構造分析を提供する、(3)古典出典を引用する。SajuAstrology.comはこの3つを全て無料で提供し、クレジットカード入力や会員登録は不要です。

### サジュ相性診断はMBTI相性より正確ですか?

精度の点では明確に上です。MBTIは16タイプ、サジュは518,400通り — 32,400倍の解像度差があります。さらにMBTIは自己申告アンケートで結果が時期により変わりますが、サジュは固定された出生時刻を使うため結果が一貫します。客観性と精密性の両面でサジュが優位です。

### 「相性が悪い」と出たら別れるべきですか?

いいえ。「相性が低い」という結果は「あなたたちの間に特定の摩擦パターンが存在する」という意味で、「別れるべき」という意味ではありません。難しい相性でもそのパターンを理解しているカップルが、楽な相性で関係スキルを磨かなかったカップルより長く続くことが多いです。診断は情報、決断はあなたのものです。

### 出生時間が分からなくても相性診断できますか?

最も精密な分析には出生時間が必要ですが、不明でもSajuAstrologyは年・月・日のデータから意味のある相性分析を生成できます。ただし時柱関連のインサイトと大運の精度はやや低くなります。

### サジュ相性診断はどのくらい時間がかかりますか?

AI技術を活用した最新の相性診断は、生年月日を入力してから約30秒で完成します。伝統的な対面占い師による診断は1〜2時間かかることもありますが、計算の正確性自体は同じです。違いは解釈の深さとパーソナライズの度合いです。

    content: `# The World's Most Iconic Couples Through the Lens of Korean Saju

**Celebrity Compatibility Series — Vol. 1**

*An entertainment-oriented look at what 5,000-year-old Korean astrology might say about five of the most-watched partnerships on Earth. Not predictions. Not judgments. A cultural lens.*

When Western astrology pairs you by Sun sign — one of twelve broad categories — Korean Saju (사주, "Four Pillars of Destiny") does something more granular. It reads four pillars of your birth moment (year, month, day, hour) and generates one of **518,400 possible cosmic profiles**. For couples, Saju compares two full charts to describe *how two energy patterns interact* — not who is "better" or "worse."

This series brings that Korean lens to couples the whole world already knows. We'll look at five for Volume 1. The goal is not to predict anything. It is to show how this tradition reads partnerships, and to give you a vocabulary for thinking about your own.

---

## How Saju Reads a Couple

Before we get into specific couples, here's the quick version of what Korean Saju actually looks at when comparing two people:

- **Day Master (일간 / il-gan)** — the single Chinese character that represents your core self. There are ten: Yang Wood (甲), Yin Wood (乙), Yang Fire (丙), Yin Fire (丁), Yang Earth (戊), Yin Earth (己), Yang Metal (庚), Yin Metal (辛), Yang Water (壬), and Yin Water (癸).
- **Five Elements balance (오행 / o-haeng)** — how much Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water each person carries. Good couples often *complete* each other's element gaps.
- **Year Pillar (년주 / nyeon-ju)** — the generational energy. Couples with harmonious year pillars often report feeling "like they've known each other forever."
- **Clash or Harmony (충·합 / chung-hap)** — specific structural relationships between the eight characters that show friction points and resonance points.

Traditional Saju practitioners will also look at hour pillar (requires exact birth time), ten-year cycles (대운), and current-year interactions. For celebrity readings where precise birth hours are rarely public, we'll stay at the year/month/day level — which is already plenty to talk about.

**One disclaimer we'll keep repeating**: Saju describes *tendencies in energy patterns*, not predictions of the future. A chart doesn't say a couple will "make it" or "fail." It describes the texture of how two people's energies meet. What they do with that texture is entirely up to them.

---

## 1. Beyoncé × Jay-Z — The Water and Wood Dynasty

- **Beyoncé** · born September 4, 1981
- **Jay-Z** · born December 4, 1969

Right away, Saju notices something poetic here: both were born on the **4th day of their respective months**. The couple has famously built much of their public mythology around the number four (their wedding was on 4/4/2008, their matching tattoos read "IV"). In Saju, the day pillar carries your core self — and two partners sharing a day *number* (not the same day pillar, but the same numerical position) often creates a subtle resonance traditional readers call *柱共鳴 ("pillar resonance")*.

### The Element Read

Jay-Z was born in early December 1969 — a **Water-dominant month in a Metal-Earth year**. In Korean Saju, December corresponds to the 子 (Rat) month, which is pure Water energy. This gives him a chart where **strategy, depth, and patience** are natural resources. Water in Saju is not passive — it carves canyons. It's the element of vision and long-term architecture. (Jay-Z's entire business empire, built over three decades rather than three years, reads accurately with this element.)

Beyoncé's September 1981 birth falls in the 酉 (Rooster) month — pure **Metal energy**. Metal in Saju represents refinement, discipline, and the ability to cut away what doesn't serve the final form. (Anyone who has watched her rehearsal footage understands Metal.) Her 1981 year is a Yin Metal year, reinforcing that refinement tendency.

### What Saju Would Say About the Pairing

In the Five Elements cycle, **Metal produces Water** (金生水). This is considered one of the most supportive generative relationships in Korean astrology — the older element *feeds* the younger. Beyoncé's Metal naturally flows into Jay-Z's Water, and Water in turn nourishes the Wood of creative output that both are known for.

This is not a chart of "opposites attract." It's a chart of **one energy nourishing another in a productive chain**. Traditional Saju texts describe this as 相生 (sang-saeng / mutual generation) — the kind of partnership where the long view rewards both partners.

### A fan reading, not a prediction

The couple's 20+ years together, their public commitment to the number four, and their shared creative output read interestingly through this lens. Again: not destiny. Just a cultural read on the chart.

## 2. David × Victoria Beckham — Fire Meeting Fire

- **David Beckham** · born May 2, 1975
- **Victoria Beckham** · born April 17, 1974

The Beckhams have been married since 1999 — one of the longest-running celebrity power couples of the modern era. Saju has a phrase for their chart combination: 同氣相求 (dong-gi sang-gu / "like energies seek each other").

### The Element Read

David Beckham was born in **early May 1975** — the 巳 (Snake) month, which is **Yin Fire** energy. May is when spring finishes and summer begins to burn. People born in this window often have the classic Fire qualities: visibility, charisma, the ability to walk into a room and shift the temperature. David's 1975 year adds Wood to the chart, and **Wood feeds Fire** (木生火). This is a self-reinforcing chart — an engine that runs on its own fuel.

Victoria was born in **mid-April 1974** — the 辰 (Dragon) month, which is **Yang Earth** with Wood undertones. Her 1974 year (Wood Tiger) reinforces Wood. So Victoria brings a chart of **Wood-and-Earth** — the combination that traditional Saju associates with *structure*, *lasting foundation*, and what Korean practitioners sometimes call 土德 (to-deok / "earth virtue").

### What Saju Would Say About the Pairing

Wood feeds Fire (木生火). Earth holds Fire in place and prevents it from burning out (火生土 in reverse — Earth becomes the product of Fire).

In Saju language, Victoria's Wood-Earth chart **literally produces and stabilizes** David's Fire. A Fire person without grounding tends to burn bright and burn fast. A Fire person with Earth support burns long. Traditional Korean marriage readings place enormous weight on this configuration — it's one of the more classically "compatible" element arrangements.

Their 25+ years together, through global moves (Manchester → Madrid → Los Angeles → Miami) and four children, map onto this pattern of "Fire staying lit because Earth keeps the hearth." Again — a cultural lens, not a prediction. But the lens describes what we can observe.

## 3. Hyun Bin × Son Ye-jin — The Autumn Harmony

- **Hyun Bin (현빈 / 玄彬)** · born September 25, 1982
- **Son Ye-jin (손예진 / 孫藝珍)** · born January 11, 1982

Known to global fans as the "Binjin couple" since their 2022 marriage, Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin met on the set of *Crash Landing on You* — the drama that brought Korean romance to 190+ countries via Netflix. In Korea they are routinely called the 국민 커플 ("nation's couple"). Their Saju reading is, for Korean audiences especially, one of the most analyzed celebrity charts of the decade.

### The Element Read

They were **born in the same year — 1982**. In Saju that year's pillar is 壬戌 (Yang Water Dog). Sharing a year pillar creates what Korean readers call 동갑 (dong-gap) — a generational resonance. Partners who share the same year-pillar often report an unusual ease of mutual understanding; they grew up with the same energetic weather.

Hyun Bin's September 25 birthday places him in the 酉 (Rooster) month — **Yin Metal**, like Beyoncé. Metal in Saju is associated with refinement, clarity of purpose, and a certain quiet intensity. It is considered the element of the artist who practices a craft for decades.

Son Ye-jin's January 11 birthday falls in the 丑 (Ox) month — **Yin Earth** with Water and Metal undertones. The Ox is the quiet worker of the Chinese zodiac, but in Saju its hidden stems (藏干) often produce people with surprising depth beneath a calm exterior.

### What Saju Would Say About the Pairing

**Earth produces Metal** (土生金). Son Ye-jin's Yin Earth chart naturally generates and supports Hyun Bin's Yin Metal. The two pillars share a Metal undertone (his main, her hidden), which in classical readings suggests an unusual level of *shared internal vocabulary* — they speak the same inner language without having to translate.

Their shared 1982 Yang Water year adds another layer: **both of them carry Water in the year pillar**, which feeds the Wood of creativity and softens Metal's sharpness with Water's fluidity. This is why many Korean Saju practitioners publicly called this match "이상적 (ideal)" when it was announced in 2021.

---

## 4. Priyanka Chopra × Nick Jonas — The Cross-Cultural Yin-Yang

- **Priyanka Chopra Jonas** · born July 18, 1982
- **Nick Jonas** · born September 16, 1992

Priyanka and Nick's pairing is one of the most globally visible East-meets-West partnerships of our generation. Married in 2018 with both Christian and Hindu ceremonies, they represent the kind of modern cross-cultural partnership that Korean Saju, as a tradition, actually handles beautifully — because Saju reads *energy patterns*, not nationality.

### The Element Read

Priyanka's July 18, 1982 birth places her in the **未 (Goat) month — Yin Earth** with strong Fire influence from the summer peak. July in Saju is late summer, when Earth has absorbed all the Fire of the season. This produces what classical texts call 火土 (fire-earth) personalities — warm, generative, deeply caring. Her 1982 Yang Water year adds depth and intuition.

Nick's September 16, 1992 birth places him in the **酉 (Rooster) month — Yin Metal** (same month as Hyun Bin and Beyoncé). Metal born in autumn at its full strength. His 1992 year (Yang Water Monkey) brings Water and Metal together — a cool, precise, musical configuration. Anyone who has watched Nick Jonas's musicianship knows the discipline of Yin Metal in autumn.

### What Saju Would Say About the Pairing

**Earth produces Metal** (土生金) — again, the same generative flow we saw with the Binjin couple. Priyanka's Earth nourishes and strengthens Nick's Metal. In relationship terms, this is traditionally described as the chart of "a partner who makes you more yourself" — not a clash, but a deepening.

Their 10-year age gap, which the couple has addressed publicly, actually reads *constructively* in Saju. Wider age gaps mean the partners' **year pillars don't clash** — they come from different ten-year cycles (대운) and therefore rarely trigger each other's pressure points simultaneously. Traditional Korean matchmakers often recommend gaps of this size for Earth-Metal pairings.

## 5. Cristiano Ronaldo × Georgina Rodríguez — The Strategic Metal Pair

- **Cristiano Ronaldo** · born February 5, 1985
- **Georgina Rodríguez** · born January 27, 1994

Engaged in 2025 after nearly a decade together, Cristiano and Georgina represent a Portuguese-Argentinian-Spanish partnership that has moved with the rhythm of his career — Madrid, Turin, Manchester, Riyadh. Five children, a globally watched Netflix docuseries (*I Am Georgina*), and a public partnership built in full view of billions of football fans.

### The Element Read

Cristiano's February 5, 1985 birth places him right at the cusp between **丑 (Ox) and 寅 (Tiger) months** — a transitional pillar. Early February in the Saju calendar is when **Wood begins to emerge from Earth**. This produces what traditional readers call 立春 (ip-chun) personalities — "standing at the beginning of spring." The energy is: strong foundation (Earth), but already reaching upward (Wood). Ambition anchored in discipline.

Georgina's January 27, 1994 birth is in the **丑 (Ox) month — Yin Earth** (same as Son Ye-jin), but her 1994 year is 甲戌 (Yang Wood Dog). So her chart brings **Earth stabilized by Wood** — grounding plus growth.

### What Saju Would Say About the Pairing

Here's where the reading gets interesting. Both partners carry **Ox-month Earth energy**, which Saju describes as 同柱 (dong-ju / "shared pillar"). Partners who share the same month pillar often build their lives around the same rhythms — they work the same hours, they want the same things at the same time, they get tired at the same season.

Cristiano's emerging Wood finds root in Georgina's stable Earth. Georgina's Wood finds Fire-support in Cristiano's February-Fire undertones. It's a four-way element weave where **neither partner is the only source of any element** — a hallmark of charts traditionally called 相互依存 (sang-ho ui-jon / "mutually interdependent"). These are not codependent charts; they're charts where both partners bring resources to the table.

Nine years together, five children, and a relocation to Riyadh for his Al-Nassr contract all suggest a partnership that handles structural change well — which is exactly what Ox-Earth pairings are classically good at.

## What This Series Is Not

This is a cultural and entertainment read. It is not:

- A prediction that any of these couples will stay together or separate
- A claim that Saju is deterministic
- A judgment on anyone's relationship, marriage, or personal life

Korean Saju is a 5,000-year-old observational system. Its value is in giving us **a vocabulary for thinking about partnerships** — not a verdict. Every couple's real life is made of choices, growth, and private dimensions no chart can see.

「四柱推命の相性って、実際どう読むの?」「相生(そうせい)と相克(そうこく)って何が違うの?」

韓国ドラマや K-POP をきっかけに、韓国式の四柱推命(サジュ/사주)で恋愛相性を見る人が日本でも急速に増えています。検索キーワード「四柱推命 相性」「サジュ 相性 無料」の検索数は前年比で大きく伸び、Google Search Console のデータでもクリック率が他ジャンルを上回っています。

でも、相性診断のサイトで「点数」だけ出されても、**なぜその点数なのかが分からないと意味がない**。このガイドでは、四柱推命が相性を見る時に実際に読んでいる**五行の10パターン**を、一つずつ丁寧に解説します。

## そもそも四柱推命の相性とは?

四柱推命は生年月日時から**「年柱・月柱・日柱・時柱」の4つの柱**を立て、それぞれに**天干(てんかん)と地支(ちし)**を配置します。計8つの文字が、その人のエネルギーパターンを表します。

相性を見る時、四柱推命は**2人の五行(木・火・土・金・水)がどう関係しているか**を重点的に読みます。五行には**10種類のパターン**があります:

- **相生(そうせい)** — 一方が他方を生かす関係(5パターン)
- **相克(そうこく)** — 一方が他方を制する関係(5パターン)

「相生=良い」「相克=悪い」ではありません。**どちらも必要な関係性**です。相生だけの組み合わせは成長しますが緊張感がなくなり、相克だけの組み合わせは刺激がありますが消耗します。**実際の相性は両方が混ざった複雑な織物**として読まれます。

## 五行の基本 — 4行でまとめると

本題に入る前に、五行それぞれの性質をごく短くまとめます:

- **木(もく)** — 成長・拡張・計画。外へ伸びるエネルギー。
- **火(か)** — 表現・情熱・可視性。上へ燃えるエネルギー。
- **土(ど)** — 安定・受容・変換。中心を保つエネルギー。

## 相生の5パターン ― 支え合う関係

相生(そうせい)とは、片方の五行がもう片方を**生み出し、育てる**関係です。恋愛においては「一緒にいると自然と伸びていく」感覚が特徴です。

### 1. 木 × 火 ― 燃え上がるタイプ (木生火)

**木は火を生みます**。木が燃えることで火は強くなります。これは四柱推命で最も情熱的とされる相生パターンです。

- **木の人** — 理想家、計画家、外へ広がるエネルギー
- **火の人** — 表現者、情熱家、場を明るくする存在

このペアの特徴は、**木の人のビジョンを火の人が世界に届ける**関係です。二人で一緒にいると、単独の時より「見える場所」に立つことが多くなります。注意点は、火が強すぎると木を燃やし尽くしてしまうこと。お互いのペースを尊重することが大切です。

### 2. 火 × 土 ― 育てるタイプ (火生土)

**火が燃えた後に灰(土)が残り、土壌を豊かにします**。これは四柱推命の相性の中でも「家庭を作る」エネルギーが最も強いパターンです。

- **火の人** — 情熱・表現・瞬発力
- **土の人** — 受容・安定・持続力

火の人のエネルギーを土の人が受け止めて、**長く続く生活の基盤へ変換**します。韓国の伝統的な婚姻占いでは、この組み合わせを「家を建てる相性(家を築く命式)」と呼び、長期的な関係に非常に向いているとされます。

### 3. 土 × 金 ― 磨き合うタイプ (土生金)

**土の中から金属が採れます**。土が金を育てる関係です。これは派手さはありませんが、四柱推命では「職人的な関係」と呼ばれる、最も安定した相生パターンの一つです。

- **土の人** — 支える、受け止める、変わらない
- **金の人** — 磨く、精密化する、完成させる

土の人が提供する安定した環境の中で、金の人が自分の能力を**研ぎ澄ませていく**。お互いを派手に変えることはありませんが、**10年後、20年後に振り返った時に「一緒にいて良かった」と感じる**タイプの相性です。

### 4. 金 × 水 ― 深まっていくタイプ (金生水)

**金属の表面に結露するように、金から水が生まれます**。これは四柱推命で「深さ」を生むパターンです。

- **金の人** — 判断力・美学・明快さ
- **水の人** — 知恵・内省・長期視座

金の明快さが水の深さに流れ込むと、**戦略性とビジョンを併せ持つパートナーシップ**が生まれます。ビジネスで成功している夫婦にこのパターンがよく見られます。欠点は、外から見ると「クールすぎる」と映ること。二人の間の温かさは、外に見せるものではなく、内側で深まっていくタイプです。

### 5. 水 × 木 ― 広がっていくタイプ (水生木)

**水が根に染み込むと、木は成長します**。これは四柱推命の相性の中で最も「未来志向」なパターンです。

- **水の人** — 深さ・計画・資源
- **木の人** — 成長・拡張・アクション

水の人が蓄えてきたものを、木の人が世界へ広げていく。**夢を現実にするコンビ**として読まれることが多く、一緒にいる時間と共に二人の影響範囲が広がっていく傾向があります。水が枯れないよう、木の人が「どこから水が来ているか」を忘れないことが長続きの鍵です。

---

## 相克の5パターン ― 刺激し合う関係

相克(そうこく)とは、片方の五行がもう片方を**制する、または変化させる**関係です。「悪い」という意味ではありません。**お互いに成長を促す緊張感**を生むパターンです。

### 6. 木 × 土 ― 変化を促すタイプ (木克土)

**木の根は土を分け、土を動かします**。木の人が土の人の「安定の殻」を揺さぶるパターンです。

- **木の人** — 動こう、変えよう、挑戦しよう
- **土の人** — 今のままで十分、安定を守ろう

このペアは、**相手のおかげで自分一人では行けなかった場所へ行く**ことが特徴です。土の人は木の人のおかげで新しい景色を見、木の人は土の人のおかげで基盤を持ちます。短期的に摩擦が生じやすいですが、**長期的には最も成長が大きい**相克パターンとされます。

### 7. 土 × 水 ― 受け止めるタイプ (土克水)

**土は水の流れを堰き止めます**。土の人が水の人の「感情の流れ」に形を与えるパターンです。

- **土の人** — 現実・構造・受容
- **水の人** — 感情・直感・流動

水の人は感情が深く豊かですが、時に方向性を失いがちです。土の人は水の人に**安心して流れる器**を提供します。水の人にとって、土のパートナーは「やっと呼吸ができる場所」になることが多いです。ただし、土が強すぎると水が窒息することもあるので、**お互いの呼吸を尊重する**ことが大切です。

### 8. 水 × 火 ― 覚醒させるタイプ (水克火)

**水は火を消します**。これは最も激しい相克パターンの一つです。

- **水の人** — 冷静・分析・慎重
- **火の人** — 感情・表現・衝動

一見、相性が悪そうに見えます。しかし四柱推命では、**このパターンこそが「人生の転換点」を生む相性**と読まれます。火の人が単独では止まれない時、水の人が止めてくれる。水の人が動けない時、火の人が火をつけてくれる。**お互いを目覚めさせる関係**です。長続きの鍵は、どちらも相手を「消す」のではなく「律する」姿勢を保つことです。

### 9. 火 × 金 ― 鍛え合うタイプ (火克金)

**火は金属を溶かし、形を変えます**。火の人が金の人の「固まった形」を溶かして、新しい形を作るパターンです。

- **火の人** — 情熱・行動・変化
- **金の人** — 完成・洗練・保守

金の人は既に完成された美しさを持っていますが、時に「変化できない」壁にぶつかります。火の人は金の人を**溶かして、新しい形に再生させる**触媒です。このペアは、出会いの後に**お互いが別人のように成長する**傾向があります。重要なのは、火が金を「破壊」するのではなく「再形成」する意図で関わることです。

### 10. 金 × 木 ― 整えるタイプ (金克木)

**斧(金)は木を切って、形を整えます**。金の人が木の人の「伸びすぎたエネルギー」を剪定するパターンです。

- **金の人** — 判断・洗練・明快
- **木の人** — 成長・拡張・可能性

木の人は放っておくと全方向に伸びすぎて、結果を出せないことがあります。金の人は木の人に**「この方向に集中しよう」という剪定の視点**を提供します。芸術家と編集者、起業家と共同創業者、俳優とマネージャー — このタイプのペアは**才能を実現させる相性**として読まれます。

**いいえ**。相克のパターンの中にも、長続きする素晴らしい関係は多くあります。むしろ相克は「お互いを成長させる」相性とも読まれます。実際、伝統的な韓国の婚姻占いでは「完全に相生だけのペア」より「相生と相克が適度に混ざったペア」の方が長続きすると言われることもあります。

### Q. 生まれた時間が分かりません

日主は**生年月日**だけで計算できるので、時間が不明でも相性の基本パターンは分かります。時間が分かればより詳細な分析ができますが、**分からなくても十分使える診断**です。

### Q. 点数が低いと別れた方がいいですか?

四柱推命は**予言ではなく、エネルギーパターンの説明**です。「点数」はあくまで相性の「テクスチャー」を数値化したもの。実際の関係は、二人の**選択・成長・コミュニケーション**が決めます。四柱推命が教えてくれるのは「どこに注意すればうまく流れるか」であって、「運命は決まっている」ではありません。

### Q. 相生同士で結婚すれば絶対うまくいきますか?

相生パターンは**出発点が楽**ですが、刺激や成長が少ないため、**倦怠期が来やすい**とも言われます。相性は出発点ではなく「10年後、20年後にどう育てるか」です。

## まとめ

四柱推命の相性を決めるのは、**五行の10パターン**です:

- **相生5パターン** — 木×火、火×土、土×金、金×水、水×木
- **相克5パターン** — 木×土、土×水、水×火、火×金、金×木

どのパターンも「良い・悪い」ではなく、**異なる成長の仕方**を意味します。相生は自然に支え合い、相克はお互いを覚醒させます。

大切なのは、**自分たちの相性パターンを知った上で、それをどう活かすか**です。四柱推命は予言ではなく、**「あなたたちはこういうテクスチャーを持っている」という地図**を渡してくれる伝統です。

## 「四柱推命」と「韓国式サジュ」は同じ?違う?

実は、**同じ起源で、発展の仕方が違う**兄弟です。

四柱推命(しちゅうすいめい)は、**中国で紀元前から発展した「四柱八字(しちゅうはちじ)」**が日本に伝わり、江戸時代頃から独自に発展した占術です。

韓国式サジュ(사주)は、同じ四柱八字が朝鮮王朝時代に韓国に伝わり、**「宮合(궁합 / グンハプ)」**という独自の相性診断文化として発展しました。韓国では今でも結婚前に**宮合を見るのが一般的な文化**として生きています。

| 項目 | 日本の四柱推命 | 韓国式サジュ |
|---|---|---|
| 起源 | 中国の四柱八字(汎東アジア) | 中国の四柱八字(汎東アジア) |
| 主な用途 | 個人の運勢・性格 | 個人の運勢 + **結婚前の宮合(相性)** |
| 相性の重要度 | 補助的 | **中心的・生活文化** |
| 現代の実用 | 個別鑑定中心 | 宮合が日常的(家族・友人間でも) |
| 分析の厚み | 通変星・十二運を重視 | **五行バランス + 日支関係 + 大運の交わり**を重層的に |

つまり、**相性を読む際に重視するポイント・伝統的に蓄積されてきた視点が、日本式と韓国式では少し異なります**。どちらが優れているという話ではなく、**視点の違い**があります。韓国式サジュは特に「宮合」という相性文化が生活に根ざしているため、**相性分析に特化した視点**を持っています。

日本式四柱推命で相性を見ることに加えて、**韓国式の視点も試してみたい**方にとって、本記事で紹介するサービスは一つの選択肢になるでしょう。

## 韓国式サジュが「相性」で読んでいる5つのレイヤー

日本の多くの相性占いは、**日干(日主)同士を比較するだけ**で終わります。しかし、それは相性の**表層1割**しか見ていません。

韓国式サジュは、相性を**5つのレイヤー**で重層的に読みます。

### レイヤー1 — 五行バランスの補完関係

あなたの命式全体で**足りない五行**を、相手が持っているか。
逆に、相手に足りない五行を、あなたが持っているか。

これが「お互いを完成させる関係」の核心です。例えば、あなたの命式に「水」がほとんどなく、相手の命式に「水」が豊富な場合、**相手はあなたの人生に深みと知恵をもたらす存在**として機能します。

### レイヤー2 — 日主×日主の直接関係

これが一般的な「相性占い」が見ている部分です。十干同士が**相生(そうせい)**・**相克(そうこく)**・**比和(ひわ)**のどれに当たるかを見ます。

- **相生** — 一方がもう一方を生かす(例: 水→木)
- **相克** — 一方がもう一方を制する(例: 水→火)
- **比和** — 同じ五行同士(例: 木×木)

相克=悪い、ではありません。お互いを**成長させる緊張感**を生むパターンです。

### レイヤー3 — 日支(にっし)同士の関係

ここから韓国式の深さが出てきます。**日柱の下段にある十二支(日支)同士が、どう関わっているか**を見ます。

- **支合(しごう)** — 二つの地支が寄り添って一つになる
- **三合(さんごう)** — 三つの地支が三角形の調和を作る
- **冲(ちゅう)** — 正反対の位置にあり、刺激し合う
- **刑(けい)・破(は)・害(がい)** — 小さな違和感を生む関係

韓国の伝統的な宮合では、**日支同士の冲(日支冲)は注意深く読まれます**。ただし、冲=別れではありません。お互いを**目覚めさせる関係**として、成長型の相性になることも多いのです。

### レイヤー4 — 大運(だいうん)の交わり

ここは日本の相性占いではほとんど見られない部分です。韓国式サジュでは、**二人のそれぞれの大運(10年周期の運気)が、今この時期にどう交わっているか**を見ます。

- 二人とも上昇期で出会った → 短期的に盛り上がりやすいが、下降期で試される
- 一方が上昇期、もう一方が整理期 → 補完関係が生まれやすい
- 二人とも安定期 → 穏やかに深まっていく

これを見ないと、**「今なぜ惹かれ合っているのか」「この関係はどう変化していくか」**が分かりません。

### レイヤー5 — 時柱(じちゅう)の響き合い

生まれた時間が分かる場合、**時柱の響き合い**まで見ます。時柱は「晩年の運気」と「内面の深いパターン」を表すため、ここが噛み合うかどうかは、**長期的な関係性の深さ**に直結します。

## 五行相性 早見表 — 自分と相手の日主でチェック

自分と相手の**日主(日柱の天干)**が分かれば、基本的な相性関係がすぐ分かります。

### まず自分の日主を調べる

[**→ 自分の命式を無料で出す**](https://sajuastrology.com/) ← 生年月日を入れるだけ

日主は10種類です。

| 日主 | 読み方 | 五行 |
|---|---|---|
| 甲 | こう | 陽の木 |
| 乙 | おつ | 陰の木 |
| 丙 | へい | 陽の火 |
| 丁 | てい | 陰の火 |
| 戊 | ぼ | 陽の土 |
| 己 | き | 陰の土 |
| 庚 | こう | 陽の金 |
| 辛 | しん | 陰の金 |
| 壬 | じん | 陽の水 |
| 癸 | き | 陰の水 |

### 五行同士の関係性

二人の日主の**五行**が分かれば、基本関係が決まります。

| 関係 | 組み合わせ | 恋愛での意味 |
|---|---|---|
| **相生(支え合う)** | 木→火 / 火→土 / 土→金 / 金→水 / 水→木 | 自然に育てあう。倦怠期には注意。 |
| **相克(刺激し合う)** | 木→土 / 土→水 / 水→火 / 火→金 / 金→木 | 互いを目覚めさせる。成長型。 |
| **比和(同じ)** | 木×木 / 火×火 / 土×土 / 金×金 / 水×水 | 価値観が似て楽。違いが見えない危険。 |

## なぜ「AI鑑定」なのか — 仕組みの違いを理解する

無料で相性を見られるサービスには、大きく分けて**2つのタイプ**があります。

**タイプA: 事前作成型** — 日主の組み合わせ(10×10=100パターン)ごとに、あらかじめ用意された解説文を表示する方式。多くの無料相性占いサイトがこの方式を採用しています。処理が速く、提供コストも低いため、**広く普及している確立されたアプローチ**です。

**タイプB: 実時間生成型** — 入力された二人の命式に対して、AIが毎回ゼロから解釈を生成する方式。韓国式サジュAI鑑定はこちらです。古典引用を参照しながら、あなたの固有の8文字と相手の固有の8文字の組み合わせを、その場で計算して読み解きます。

どちらが**絶対的に優れている**というものではありません。それぞれに用途と特性があります。ただし、**「二人だけの固有の組み合わせをその場で読み解いてほしい」**という目的には、タイプBの方が構造的に適しています。

### 実時間生成エンジンの仕組み

1. **真太陽時の補正** — あなたの生まれた都市の経度で、±15分まで正確に補正
2. **8文字の算出** — 年柱・月柱・日柱・時柱の天干地支、計8文字を算出
3. **ベクトル化** — 562の古典引用を1,536次元のベクトル空間に配置
4. **コサイン類似度検索** — あなたの8文字に最も近い古典引用を自動抽出
5. **Gemini (解釈) × Claude (検証)** — 二つの独立AIが相互検証
6. **5段階フォールバック** — 99.9%の稼働率で失敗しない

**結果として、あなたが出される鑑定は、世界で一つだけ**です。同じ生年月日の人が世界に何万人いても、**入力された「相手」が違えば結果も変わります**。518,400通りの固有プロファイル × 518,400通りの組み合わせ = 約2,700億通りの可能性を、毎回ゼロから計算します。

## 韓国で実際に行われている「宮合(궁합)」の流れを知っていますか

少し余談になりますが、韓国式サジュの相性診断がどれだけ**生活に根ざしているか**を知ると、このAI鑑定の深さが理解しやすくなります。

韓国では結婚が決まると、多くの家庭で**궁합(グンハプ = 宮合)**を見に行きます。これは単なる「占い」ではなく、**結婚前の準備儀礼**の一部として扱われます。

### 韓国式宮合の伝統的な流れ

1. **四柱単자(사주단자)の交換** — 男女双方の生年月日時を紙に書き、両家で交換する
2. **宮合師への依頼** — 経験豊富な宮合師(궁합사)に、双方の命式を渡して読み解きを依頼
3. **겉궁합(外宮合)と속궁합(内宮合)** — 表面的な相性(性格・生活)と、深層の相性(内面・価値観)を別々に読む
4. **대운(大運)の交わり** — 二人がこの後10~20年、どんな運気の中で出会い、どう流れていくかを読む
5. **結果の説明と対策** — 「この部分は気をつけて、こう補い合えば良い」という具体的アドバイス

ポイントは、**結果が「結婚すべき/すべきでない」という二択ではない**ことです。宮合師が渡すのは、**「この二人が共に人生を歩む上での地図」**です。

**韓国式サジュAI鑑定は、この5,000年の宮合文化を、AIで再現しようとしています**。562の古典引用には、こうした歴代の宮合師たちが蓄積してきた洞察が含まれています。

## AI二重検証の実際 — Gemini と Claude は何をしているのか

「AI鑑定」と聞くと、「ChatGPTに聞いているだけでは?」と思われる方もいるかもしれません。実際には、**ChatGPTのような汎用AIに相性を聞いても、正確な四柱推命の読み解きは出てきません**。

なぜなら、汎用AIは**「四柱推命全体の知識」**は持っていても、**「あなた専用の命式に、どの古典引用が関連するか」**を判断できないからです。

### 韓国式サジュAI鑑定の裏側

1. **真太陽時の補正** — あなたが生まれた都市の経度を使い、±15分まで正確に太陽時を補正します。ソウル生まれとと東京生まれでは、同じ「午後2時」でも太陽時が32分違います。この誤差が時柱を変えてしまうため、多くの無料サイトが**省いている部分**を、ここでは丁寧に処理しています。

2. **命式の算出** — 補正された真太陽時から、年柱・月柱・日柱・時柱の8文字を算出します。

3. **ベクトル化** — 滴天髄・窮通宝鑑・子平真詮・淵海子平・三命通会の5冊から選ばれた**562の核心引用**を、1,536次元のベクトル空間にあらかじめ配置してあります。あなたの8文字も同じベクトル空間に変換されます。

4. **コサイン類似度検索** — あなたの命式ベクトルに最も「近い」古典引用を、自動で上位抽出します。これがRAG(Retrieval-Augmented Generation)の仕組みです。

5. **Gemini による解釈** — Googleが開発した大規模言語モデル Gemini が、抽出された古典引用を元に、あなた専用の相性解釈を生成します。

6. **Claude による検証** — Anthropic社が開発した Claude が、Gemini の出力を**独立に再検証**します。矛盾や誤りがあれば指摘し、修正します。

7. **5段階フォールバック** — 万が一どちらかのAIが応答しない場合も、5段階のフォールバック機構が働き、99.9%の稼働率を維持します。

**この仕組み全体が、一つの相性診断あたり約30秒で完了します**。人間の宮合師が数時間かけていた読み解きの一部を、AIが再現しようとしているのです。

もちろん、**人間の宮合師の「直感」や「人生経験からくる洞察」は、まだAIには置き換えられません**。ただし、**古典の網羅性・計算の正確性・言語の一貫性**においては、AIが人間を超え始めている領域でもあります。

## 四柱推命の相性でよくある3つの誤解

無料の相性診断をする前に、**多くの人が持っている3つの誤解**を解いておきましょう。これを知っているかどうかで、結果の読み方が大きく変わります。

### 誤解1「相性が悪い=別れるべき」

**これは最も広がっている誤解**です。四柱推命で「相性」と呼ばれるものは、**「二人のエネルギーがどう相互作用するか」のパターン**であり、**「別れるべきか否か」の指示**ではありません。

例えば、相克関係(水×火、木×土など)は「刺激し合う関係」と読まれます。これは**お互いを目覚めさせる関係**であり、伝統的な韓国の宮合では「大きな成長を生むペア」とも言われます。実際、長続きしている夫婦には相克関係のカップルも多く、「お互いがいなければ今の自分はなかった」と語る方も珍しくありません。

**大切なのは、自分たちの相性パターンを知った上で、その特性を活かす工夫をすること**です。

### 誤解2「日主だけ見れば相性が分かる」

日本の多くの無料相性占いが**「日主同士の比較」だけ**で相性を出しているため、こう思われがちです。

しかし、韓国式サジュでは、**日主は相性の1/5のレイヤーにすぎません**。先ほど紹介した5つのレイヤー:

1. 五行バランスの補完関係
2. 日主×日主の直接関係
3. 日支(地支)同士の関係
4. 大運の交わり
5. 時柱の響き合い

**このすべてを重層的に見て初めて、本当の相性が見えてきます**。日主だけで「良い/悪い」を判断するのは、**本を表紙だけ見て評価する**のと同じです。

### 誤解3「AIの相性診断は信頼できない」

これは**一部正しく、一部誤解を含んでいます**。

ChatGPTやGeminiなどの汎用AIに直接「私と相手の相性を見て」と聞いても、**あなた専用の深い読み解きは返ってきにくい**のが現状です。汎用AIは四柱推命の全体像は知っていても、**562の古典引用を参照し、あなた固有の命式とマッチングする専用の仕組みを持っていない**からです。

一方で、**四柱推命専用に設計されたAI(韓国式サジュAI鑑定のような仕組み)は、別のアプローチを取っています**。古典引用を事前にベクトル化し、あなたの命式と直接マッチングし、二つのAIが相互検証する構造は、**人間の鑑定師が数時間かけていた読み解きプロセスの一部を、再現可能な形で実現**しようとする試みです。

もちろん、**AIは人間の鑑定師の直感や深い人生経験を完全に置き換えるものではありません**。長年の経験を持つ宮合師・占術家の方々の対面鑑定には、AIには再現できない価値があります。AIによる無料診断は、**その入り口として、あるいは補完的な視点として**活用いただくのが適切です。

---



### Q1. 本当に無料?後で課金されませんか?

相性診断は**完全無料**です。クレジットカード入力もメールアドレス入力も不要。より深い「**マスター鑑定**」($9.99、買い切り・永久保存)を希望される方のみ、任意で購入いただけます。サブスクリプションは一切ありません。

### Q2. 生まれた時間が分かりません

**日主と月柱は生年月日だけで計算できます**。時間が不明でも、相性の主要5レイヤーのうち4レイヤーは読めます。時間が分かれば、5つ目の時柱レイヤーまで含めた完全版になります。

### Q3. 二人の生年月日だけで、本当に正確な相性が出ますか?

「正確」という言葉は慎重に使うべきです。**四柱推命は予言ではなく、エネルギーパターンの記述**です。「この二人はこういうテクスチャーを持っている」という**地図**を渡してくれるものであり、関係の実際の展開は、二人の選択・成長・コミュニケーションが作ります。

ただし、**エネルギーパターンの読み解きとしては、562の古典引用を参照し、5つのレイヤーで重層的に分析するアプローチは、無料で試せる相性診断の中でも特徴的なもの**と言えます。

### Q4. 相克だと別れた方がいいの?

**いいえ**。相克は「お互いを目覚めさせる関係」です。実際、韓国の伝統的な宮合では「**完全な相生だけのペアより、相生と相克が適度に混ざったペアの方が長続きする**」と言われることもあります。刺激のない関係は倦怠期が早く来やすいからです。

### Q5. 二人の相性診断は一回だけですか?

何回でも可能です。違う相手との相性を調べても構いません。ただし、**四柱推命は「自分の命式は変わらない」**ので、自分の部分は同じです。変わるのは「相手との組み合わせ」の読み解きだけです。

### Q6. 韓国式と日本式で結果が変わりますか?

**基本理論は同じ**ですが、重視するポイントが違います。日本式は通変星・十二運を重視し、韓国式は**五行バランス・日支関係・大運の交わり**を重視します。どちらが正しいかではなく、**視点が違う**と考えてください。両方見て比較するのも有益です。

### Q7. 二人の相性が「悪い」と出たらどうする?

まず、結果を**「警告」ではなく「地図」として読む**ことをお勧めします。「ここに注意すれば、関係はうまく流れる」というヒントです。四柱推命は「この関係はこうなる」と**断定的な結論を出す道具ではありません**。読めるのは「どこに注意すれば流れがよくなるか」という**傾向と地図**だけです。**決定するのはあなたです**。

### Q8. 他の占いサイトとの相性結果が違う時はどうする?

各サイトがどのレイヤーを見ているかが違うためです。日主だけを見るサイトと、5レイヤーを見るサイトでは結果が違うのが当然です。できるだけ**出典と方法論を明示しているサイト**を選んでください。

    content: `# MBTI Says You're an INFJ. Saju Says You're 1 of 518,400. Here's Why That Difference Matters.

> **TL;DR**: MBTI sorts the entire human population into 16 personality boxes based on a self-reported questionnaire — and even its own retest reliability hovers around 50–60%. Korean Saju (Four Pillars) uses your exact birth year, month, day, and hour to map you to 1 of 518,400 unique profiles, with no questionnaire required. For decisions that actually matter — relationships, career timing, business partners — the resolution gap changes everything.

You took the test on a Tuesday. You answered 60 questions about whether you "prefer planned or spontaneous weekends." You got INFJ. You posted it on Instagram. Your friend got INFJ too. So did 2% of the global population — roughly **160 million people**.

Then you took it again six months later. You got INFP.

Welcome to the open secret of MBTI: your "personality type" can change because you slept badly, finished a hard project, or just answered the questions in a different mood.

There's nothing wrong with using MBTI as a conversation starter. It's a useful icebreaker. But when people start making **real decisions** with it — who to date, who to hire, whether to take a job, whether to marry — the limitations stop being academic.

This article is about what an alternative looks like, and why one specific alternative — Korean Saju — has been used in East Asia for over a thousand years to do exactly the kind of decisions MBTI was never designed for.

## Quick Answer: What Is Saju, and How Is It Different from MBTI?

**Saju** (사주) is a Korean astrology system also known as the **Four Pillars of Destiny**. Instead of asking you 60 questions, it uses your **exact birth year, month, day, and hour** — four data points — to construct an eight-character chart (also called *bazi* in Chinese, "eight characters"). Each character maps to one of five elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water) and one of ten Day Masters.

The mathematical possibility space is **518,400 unique combinations**. That's **32,400× more granular than MBTI's 16 types**. And because your birth time never changes, your Saju chart is the same at age 7, age 27, and age 70.

That last property — immutability — is the one that quietly changes everything.

## The Math: 16 vs 518,400

Let's actually do the math people skip past.

MBTI claims 16 personality types. Roughly 8 billion people on Earth. **That puts ~500 million people in your "type."** When MBTI tells you that ENTJs are good at leadership, it's making a claim about half a billion humans.

Saju claims 518,400 unique birth-time configurations. ~8 billion people on Earth. **That puts ~15,000 people on Earth with your full chart.** When Saju tells you something about a Yang Wood Day Master born in the Snake month of a Tiger year, it's making a claim about a population the size of a small town — not a continent.

This isn't a small difference. This is the difference between saying *"left-handed people"* and *"left-handed people born in March who studied chemistry"*. The second statement can actually be tested. The first is too coarse to be wrong.

## At a Glance: MBTI vs Korean Saju

| Aspect | MBTI | Korean Saju |
|---|---|---|
| Number of types | 16 | 518,400 |
| Input | Self-report questionnaire (~60 questions) | Birth year + month + day + hour + city |
| Reliability across retests | ~50–60% (you may get a different type) | 100% (your birth time doesn't change) |
| Mood-dependent? | Yes — answers shift with current state | No — input is fixed at birth |
| Cultural origin | American (Briggs & Myers, 1943) | East Asian classical (1,000+ years) |
| Backed by classical sources? | Loosely Jung-influenced | 562 documented passages from 5 foundational texts |
| Compatibility analysis | Type-pair charts (256 pairings) | Five Elements + Branch combinations + Day Master cycles |
| Time-based forecasting | None | Yearly (大運/歲運) and daily (日辰) |
| Free reading | Yes (16personalities) | Yes (SajuAstrology.com) |

## The Reliability Problem MBTI Fans Don't Like to Talk About

Personality psychologists have pointed this out for decades, but it rarely makes it into TikTok content: when you take the MBTI twice, **roughly 4 out of 10 people get a different result** the second time around — sometimes within just a few weeks of the first test.

That's not a flaw in any one test. That's a fundamental property of self-report instruments. You're asking someone to introspect on their own behavior, and human introspection is famously inaccurate. We don't see our own blind spots. We answer aspirationally ("I'd like to think I'm spontaneous"). We answer based on whoever we just talked to.

Saju has the opposite property. Your birth time is a data point. It was recorded once, by your parents or your hospital, and it does not change based on whether you had a good week. The chart it produces is the same chart your grandfather would have drawn for you in 1965 if he'd known the system.

This doesn't make Saju "more true" than MBTI in some metaphysical sense. It makes Saju **more stable as a reference point**. And reference points that don't move are the only kind that are actually useful for life decisions.

## The Five Elements: What Saju Sees That MBTI Misses

MBTI gives you four binary axes: introvert/extrovert, sensing/intuition, thinking/feeling, judging/perceiving. Sixteen combinations. Done.

Saju gives you five elemental energies that exist in **proportions** within your chart, not as binary switches:

- **Wood (목)** — growth, vision, restless forward motion. Idealists. Planners.
- **Fire (화)** — passion, expression, performative warmth. Visible. Charismatic.
- **Earth (토)** — stability, mediation, grounding presence. Trustworthy. Slow.
- **Metal (금)** — precision, judgment, refined aesthetic. Decisive. Cool.
- **Water (수)** — depth, adaptability, hidden currents. Strategic. Quiet.

Your chart will have, say, 35% Wood, 20% Fire, 5% Earth, 25% Metal, 15% Water. That distribution is your signature. It tells you which energies you have surplus of (and might burn out from) and which you're missing (and need to find in partners, environments, careers).

This kind of analog, proportional reading is what MBTI categorically cannot do. INFJ doesn't tell you what percentage of you is judging. It just tells you that on the day you took the test, J narrowly beat P.

## Why This Matters for Compatibility

Here's where the resolution gap turns into a real-world consequence.

MBTI compatibility uses pair charts: ENFJ × INTP, ESTJ × ISFP, and so on. There are 256 possible pairings (16 × 16). You get a generic readout of how that pair tends to interact.

Saju compatibility — called **gunghap** in Korean — works on multiple layers simultaneously:

1. **Day Master compatibility** — how each person's core self relates to the other's
2. **Five Elements balance** — does one person provide what the other lacks?
3. **Earthly Branch combinations** — specific pair patterns called *합* (harmonies) and *충* (clashes)
4. **Long-cycle alignment** — are your 10-year fortune cycles (大運) reinforcing or fighting each other right now?
5. **Day clash check** — short-term friction patterns based on your birth days

Each of these layers has classical commentary going back centuries. The result isn't "you and they are 78% compatible." It's a structured map of where your relationship has natural energy, where friction will live, and which decade is the easiest or hardest stretch for the two of you.

You don't get that from sixteen boxes.

## Why Saju Has Survived 1,000 Years and Personality Tests Keep Cycling

MBTI was published in 1943. Enneagram in the 1970s. DISC, Big Five, attachment style — every decade or two, a new "definitive" personality framework arrives, dominates HR departments and dating apps for a while, and then quietly fades as its limitations get documented.

Saju has been used continuously since at least the **Tang and Song dynasties** in China, refined in Korea over the Joseon era, and is still consulted today by Korean families for major decisions: marriage, business launches, surgery dates, job changes. It survived because the underlying input — birth time — does not depend on a particular cultural moment. It works the same in 1024 and in 2026.

This isn't an argument that Saju is "magic." It's an argument that systems anchored to immutable data points tend to outlive systems anchored to questionnaires.

## What Modern AI Adds — And What It Doesn't Replace

Korean Saju is currently going through its largest technical transformation in centuries. Reading a Saju chart traditionally required years of study under a master, memorizing hundreds of classical passages, and learning to weigh them against each other for any given chart.

The team behind **SajuAstrology** (operated by Rimfactory, a Korean Astrotech AI startup) has indexed **562 classical passages** from five foundational texts — *Di Tian Sui*, *Qiong Tong Bao Jian*, *Zi Ping Zhen Quan*, *Yuan Hai Zi Ping*, and *San Ming Tong Hui* — into a vector database. When you input your birth time, the system finds the passages most relevant to your specific chart, and runs them through a multi-LLM cross-validation pipeline to generate a personalized reading in your language.

What this **doesn't do**: replace the wisdom of the original texts. The classical passages are still the ground truth. The AI is a translator and search engine, not an oracle.

What this **does do**: make a system that previously required 10+ years of study available in 30 seconds, in 10 languages, for free.

## So Should You Throw Out Your MBTI Result?

No. Treat MBTI as what it is: a fun, low-resolution snapshot of how you described yourself on one specific Tuesday. Use it as a conversation starter. Use it to think about whether you tend toward planning or spontaneity.

But for decisions that have weight — who you spend your life with, when to take a major risk, what kind of work environment you'll thrive in over the long term — you need a reference point that doesn't change every six months.

Your Saju chart does that. It was set on the day you were born. It will be the same chart in 2030 and in 2070. The only question is whether you've ever bothered to look at it.

## Try It Yourself — Free

Enter your birth date and time. In about 30 seconds, you'll see your full Four Pillars chart, your Day Master, your Five Elements distribution, and a personalized reading that draws on the same classical sources Korean masters have used for centuries.

No signup. No credit card. The compatibility check is free too — bring a friend's birth time, or your partner's, and see what gunghap says about your pair across all five layers.

You spent 15 minutes on a personality quiz that may be wrong tomorrow. Spend 30 seconds on the chart that's been waiting since the day you were born.

    content: `# 韓国の四柱推命「サジュ」って何? — 日本の占術文化との接点と、ちょっと違うところ

> **TL;DR**: 韓国の四柱推命(サジュ/사주)も、日本の算命学・四柱推命も、ルーツは同じ中国の古典です。両国でそれぞれ独自の発展を遂げ、見ているレイヤーが少しずつ違います。この記事では、どちらが優れているという話ではなく、「どこが共通していて、どこが違うのか」を整理します。両方を知ると、自分を読む選択肢が広がります。

K-POP アイドルの YouTube 配信で「先日サジュ(사주)を見てもらった」という話が出る。韓ドラの登場人物が大事な決断の前に「四柱を見に行こう」とつぶやく。最近、K-カルチャーをきっかけに「韓国の四柱推命」に興味を持つ日本の方が増えています。

そこで気になるのが — **「日本にも算命学や四柱推命があるけど、韓国式と何が違うの?」** という素朴な疑問です。

この記事は、その疑問を、できるだけフラットに整理することを目的にしています。**どちらが優れているという話ではありません**。両方とも長い歴史と独自の理論体系を持つ占術で、見ているレイヤーが少しずつ違うだけです。

## まず結論から — 共通する根、それぞれの花

| 項目 | 日本式(算命学・四柱推命) | 韓国式(사주/Saju) |
|---|---|---|
| 共通の古典 | 子平真詮、淵海子平、三命通会 など | 子平真詮、淵海子平、三命通会 など(同じ) |
| 主な発展時期 | 江戸〜明治期に体系化、戦後に独自展開 | 朝鮮王朝期に体系化、近代に再興 |
| 重視する読み方 | 五行・十二運・宿命星(算命学)など | 大運・歲運の流れ、真太陽時補正 |
| 命式の出し方 | 旧暦(太陰暦)+二十四節気 | 旧暦+二十四節気+真太陽時(出生地補正) |
| 用途 | 自己理解、運勢、人生設計 | 自己理解、相性(궁합)、決断のタイミング |
| 文化的位置 | 占術として独立 | 結婚・転職・起業など人生の節目で広く参照 |

**ポイント**: 元になる古典は同じですが、**何を重点的に読むか**、**どのタイミングで使うか**が両国で少し違う形に発展しています。

---

## ルーツは同じ — 中国宋代の古典

日本式の四柱推命も、韓国式のサジュも、その理論の元をたどると **中国の宋代(960〜1279年)に編まれた『淵海子平』『子平真詮』『三命通会』** といった古典に行き着きます。これは両国の占術師が共通の参考文献として使ってきた書物です。

日本には平安期から陰陽道を通じて中国の暦法・占術が伝わり、江戸時代には四柱推命の体系が一部の学者の間で知られていました。明治・大正期に再整理が進み、戦後に高木乗、阿部泰山などの研究者によって独自の発展を遂げます。

朝鮮半島でも、高麗時代から中国占術が学問として伝わり、朝鮮王朝期(1392〜1897年)には宮廷でも参照される正統な学問の一つでした。「사주(四柱)」という呼び方は、この時期に定着したものです。

つまり、両国とも「同じ古典を共有しながら、それぞれの土地で独自に深めてきた」という関係にあります。**どちらが本家ということはなく、両方とも中国古典を継承する正統な系譜**です。

---

## 日本式の特徴 — 算命学と四柱推命

日本では大きく分けて二つの系統があります。

**算命学**は、戦後に高尾義政が体系化した日本独自の占術で、人体星図、宿命星、十大主星など、独自の用語と図式を使います。中国古典の四柱推命の理論を取り込みつつ、**日本の文脈に合わせた読み解き方**を多く加えています。自己理解と人生設計のツールとして、ビジネスパーソンの間でも根強い人気があります。

**日本式四柱推命**は、より古典に忠実な系譜で、阿部泰山流などが知られています。命式の出し方は中国古典に近く、十二運や通変星を重視します。

どちらも、**命式の静的な構造(五行のバランスや十二運の配置)**を読み解くことに大きな強みを持っています。

---

## 韓国式サジュの特徴 — 流れを読む

韓国式の四柱推命は、日本式と同じ古典を参照しながら、**「時間の流れ」をかなり重点的に読む**傾向があります。

具体的には:

**大運(대운)** — 10年単位で移り変わるエネルギーの流れ。多くの韓国の占術師は、命式そのものよりも「**今、あなたがどの大運の中にいるか**」を最初にチェックします。「30代後半に来る木の大運を、どう活かすか」という時間軸の話を中心に据える文化です。

**歲運(세운)** — その年の運勢。毎年1月1日(または立春)を境に切り替わり、命式と相互作用します。

**真太陽時補正(진태양시)** — 出生地の経度から、戸籍上の時刻ではなく**実際の太陽時刻**を計算して命式を立て直します。例えばソウル生まれの人は、戸籍時刻からおよそ -32 分の補正をかけます。これは日本式でも一部の流派で行いますが、韓国式ではほぼ標準的な手順になっています。

韓国では、サジュは「占い」というより**「人生の節目に参照する道具」**として広く使われています。結婚、転職、起業、子供の名付け、引っ越し — どのタイミングが自分の大運と歲運に合うかを確認するのは、ごく一般的な習慣です。

---

## 同じ人を、二つの方法で見るとどうなる?

具体例として、仮の人物の命式を両国の流派で読んだとします。

**人物A**:1990年5月15日、午前 9 時、東京生まれ。

**日本式の読み方(算命学・四柱推命)**

- 命式の構造に注目し、五行のバランス、通変星の配置を確認
- 宿命星から性格傾向を読む
- 十二運から「人生のどのフェーズに、どんなエネルギーが配置されているか」を分析

**韓国式の読み方(サジュ)**

- 同じ命式を出すが、東京生まれなので真太陽時補正(およそ +18 分)を加える
- 五行のバランスをまず確認(これは共通)
- そのあと「現在の大運(2026年時点で何の大運の中にいるか)」を即座に読む
- 大運と命式の相互作用、今年の歲運との噛み合いを重点的に分析
- 結婚・転職などを考えている場合、相性(宮合/궁합)を別レイヤーで見る

**結果として見えてくるもの**

どちらも同じ人物を読んでいますが、日本式は「**この人はどういう人か**」というスタティックな像が中心で、韓国式は「**この人の今後10年間で、どのタイミングで何が動くか**」という時間軸の像が中心になります。

**どちらが正しいという話ではなく**、見ているレイヤーが違うのです。多くの場合、両方を読むと、自分について見えてくる像がより立体的になります。

---

## K-カルチャーで「四柱推命」がよく出てくる理由

K-POP アイドルや韓ドラで「サジュ(사주)」「宮合(궁합)」が頻繁に登場するのは、**韓国でサジュが日常生活に深く根ざしているから**です。

例えば:

- 結婚を真剣に考え始めると、お互いの命式を持ち寄って宮合を見るのが一般的な手順
- 起業のタイミング、転職の時期、子供の出産日(帝王切開で日を選べる場合)などを大運・歲運から判断する
- 名前の漢字を、子供の命式に合わせて選ぶ
- アイドルのデビュー日、企業のローンチ日を吉日選定で決めることもある

これは「占い」というニュアンスより、**「人生設計の参考データ」**に近い使われ方です。日本で算命学や四柱推命に親しむ方にとっては、**同じ古典を共有する隣国が、どう日常に組み込んできたか**を知るのは、それ自体が面白い文化的視点になります。

---

## 日本の読者が韓国式を試してみる時の入り口

「自分の命式は日本式で見たことがある。韓国式でも見てみたい」という方のために、いくつかの注目ポイントを挙げます。

**1. 真太陽時補正がかかる**
日本式でこれをやっていない場合、韓国式の命式は若干ずれる可能性があります。これは「どちらが正しい」という話ではなく、**両者は微妙に違う前提で立てた命式**なので、結果も少し違って見えるのは自然です。

**2. 大運の流れにフォーカスが行く**
日本式で「あなたの宿命星はこうです」と言われた経験のある方は、韓国式で「あなたは今、こういう大運の中にいます」という時間軸の話に重点が置かれることに、新鮮さを感じるかもしれません。

**3. 用語が漢字+ハングル**
五行、天干、地支、大運などの基本用語は両国で共通(漢字)ですが、読みが韓国語になります。日本式に親しんだ方なら、用語の対応関係はすぐに掴めます。

**4. 相性(宮合/궁합)というレイヤー**
韓国式では、二人の命式を比較して、五行バランス、地支の合・冲、大運の重なりなど **5つのレイヤー** で相性を読む文化があります。これは日本では一部の流派でしか行われず、韓国式の特徴的な領域の一つです。

---

## どちらか一方を選ぶ必要はない

ここまでの内容をまとめると、**両者は対立するものではなく、補完するもの**です。

- 日本式は、**自分の構造**を深く読むのに強い
- 韓国式は、**時間の流れと相性**を読むのに強い

両方を試してみるのも、占術を楽しむ一つの方法です。一方の視点だけでは見えなかったものが、もう一方からは見える、ということがよくあります。

特に、**結婚を考えているパートナーがいる方、大きな転職や起業のタイミングで悩んでいる方**にとっては、韓国式の「相性レイヤー」と「大運の流れ」は、日本式と組み合わせると、決断の参考材料が一段増えます。

**「四柱推命を見たいけれど、生まれた時間がわからない…」**

実は、これは多くの人が直面する課題です。母子手帳が見つからない、親に聞いても曖昧、戸籍にも載っていない — そんな状況で四柱推命の鑑定を諦めてしまう方は少なくありません。

しかし、四柱推命において時柱（じちゅう）がないと精度が落ちる — それは事実ですが、**「時間がわからない＝鑑定できない」というのは正確ではありません。**

本記事では、出生時間がわからない方のために、5つの実践的な解決策を、優先順位の高い順に丁寧に解説します。

---

## なぜ「時刻」がそれほど重要なのか — 518,400分の1の精度

四柱推命は、生年月日時を「四柱」と呼ばれる4つの柱に分解します。

| 柱 | 表すもの | 構成 |
|---|---|---|
| 年柱 | 祖先・社会的背景 | 天干1 + 地支1 |
| 月柱 | 両親・青年期 | 天干1 + 地支1 |
| 日柱 | 自分自身・配偶者 | 天干1 + 地支1（日主を含む） |
| 時柱 | 子ども・晩年・潜在能力 | 天干1 + 地支1 |

すべて合わせると、地支の連動性により**518,400通りのユニークな命式**が生まれます。

このうち時柱だけで命式の **約8.3%（1/12）** の情報量を占めます。失っても約91%は残る — これが大事なポイントです。西洋占星術は12星座、つまり1/12の解像度しかないことを思えば、時柱を除いた四柱推命でも、まだ西洋占星術より遥かに精密なのです。

---

## 解決策1: 母子健康手帳・出生証明書を確認する（最も確実）

**成功率: 90%以上**

これが最優先かつ最も確実な方法です。

### 確認できる場所

1. **母子健康手帳** — 出生時の記録欄に「分娩時刻」が記載されている場合がほとんど
2. **出生証明書（出生届の控え）** — 自治体や両親が保管している可能性
3. **病院の分娩記録** — 出産した病院に問い合わせ（保管期間に注意）

### 注意点

- 母子手帳の保管は基本的に「自分（または親）」の責任です
- 病院の分娩記録は、施設により**5〜10年程度**で廃棄されることがあります
- 古い記録ほど早めの確認を

**実家にある古いアルバムや書類の中に母子手帳が眠っていることが意外と多いです。まずはそこから。**

---

## 解決策2: 親族・両親に聞く（最も人間的）

**成功率: 状況による**

両親、祖父母、出産に立ち会った親族に直接尋ねる方法です。

### 効果的な聞き方

❌ 「私、何時に生まれたの？」（記憶が曖昧になりがち）

✅ 「私が生まれた日のこと、覚えてる？朝？昼？夕方？」

✅ 「お父さんは仕事中だった？それとも家にいた？」

✅ 「ニュースで何の番組が流れてた？」

### コツ

人間の記憶は「時刻」より「文脈」で残ります。

- 食事の時間（朝食前 / 昼食後 / 夕飯時）
- テレビ番組（朝のワイドショー / 夕方のニュース）
- 季節の光（明るかった / 暗かった）

これらの情報から、おおよその時間帯（2〜3時間の幅）を推測できる場合があります。

---

## 解決策3: 戸籍謄本・公的書類を取得する

**成功率: 限定的**

現代の日本の戸籍には、原則として**出生時刻は記載されません**。出生届には記入欄がありますが、戸籍に転記される情報には含まれない仕組みになっています。

ただし、以下の場合は記録が残っていることがあります。

- 出生届の写しが自治体の保存書類に残っている場合
- 病院から自治体への報告書類に記載がある場合
- 古い改製原戸籍に記録が残っている場合

**取得方法:** 本籍地の役所で「除籍謄本」または「改製原戸籍」を申請。料金は1通750〜1,500円程度。

期待しすぎず、「あればラッキー」程度の姿勢で。

---

## 解決策4: 時刻推測法（時柱推命）を使う

**成功率: 推測精度に依存（参考程度）**

東洋の伝統的な命理学には、**「時柱推命」**または**「時辰推算法」**と呼ばれる、その人の特徴から逆算して時刻を推測する技法があります。

### 推測の手がかり（伝統的な観点）

| 観察項目 | 時柱との関連性 |
|---|---|
| 性格の傾向 | 時柱の十神 |
| 子どもとの関係性 | 時柱の宮位 |
| 晩年の傾向 | 時柱の運勢 |
| 体質・健康傾向 | 時柱の五行バランス |

ただし、これはあくまで**経験則による推測**であり、本人の人生経験を逆引きしているため、若年層では精度が低くなる傾向があります。

**現代的な活用法:** 専門家に相談する場合、信頼できる鑑定士は推測の根拠を明確に説明してくれます。「あなたの時柱は◯◯です」と断定する人より、「複数の可能性があり、最も近いのは◯◯です」と幅を持たせる人の方が誠実です。

## 解決策5: 「正午設定」または「時刻不明モード」で鑑定する（実用的）

**成功率: 約91%の精度を維持**

最も実用的な方法です。

### 正午設定（12:00 PM）とは

時刻が不明な場合、慣習的に**「正午（12:00）」**を仮の値として入力します。これは「時柱を中立的な位置に置く」という意味があります。

**長所:**

- すぐに鑑定できる
- 年月日柱の情報（91%）はすべて活用される
- 日主、五行バランス、大運などの主要な情報は影響を受けない

**短所:**

- 時柱の解釈は信頼度が下がる
- 子ども運や晩年運の細部は参考程度に

### より精密な「時刻不明モード」

技術的にこれを更に精密化したアプローチもあります。命式の年月日柱から導かれる五行バランスを基準に、**時柱の最も整合性の高い候補を確率的に提示する**方法です。

これは現代のAI技術が得意とする領域で、562の古典原文に基づく分析と複数のLLMによる相互検証を組み合わせることで、時刻不明でも一定の精度を保った鑑定が可能になります。

## 韓国式サジュ（四柱推命）が「時刻不明」に強い理由

韓国式サジュは、もともと**儒教的伝統の中で「正確な記録」を重視する文化**で発展してきました。同時に、戦時中や貧困期に時刻記録が失われた人々のために、**時刻不明でも鑑定する技法**が体系化されてきた歴史があります。

近年では、AIと古典文献の組み合わせにより、これらの伝統技法がより精密に再現できるようになっています。

**SajuAstrology**は、562の古典原文（滴天髓・窮通寶鑑・子平眞詮・命理正宗・淵海子平の五大流派）をベースにしたRAG（検索拡張生成）と、Claude・GPT・Geminiによる複数モデル相互検証を組み合わせた、**精密な四柱推命AI**です。出生時刻が不明な場合でも「正午設定」と「時刻不明モード」を選択でき、年月日柱の情報を最大限に活用した鑑定を提供します。

開発元のRimfactoryはNVIDIA Inception Program Memberとして、Astrotech AI Startupに分類されています。私たちは四柱推命を「占い」ではなく「人間性向の統計的分類体系」として扱う技術的アプローチを取っています。

## 出生時刻不明でも、これだけは知っておきたい

### 時刻が不明でも、以下の情報は約91%の精度で確認できます

- ✅ **日主（にっしゅ）** — あなたの本質的な性格
- ✅ **五行バランス** — 木・火・土・金・水の偏り
- ✅ **年柱・月柱・日柱** — 祖先運・両親運・自分の核
- ✅ **大運（だいうん）** — 10年単位の人生の流れ
- ✅ **流年（りゅうねん）** — 今年の運勢

### 時刻が必要なのは、以下の精密分析

- ⚠️ 時柱（晩年運・子ども運の詳細）
- ⚠️ 命宮・胎元（補助的な要素）
- ⚠️ 12運星の細部

つまり、**人生の8〜9割は時刻なしでも見える**のです。

**Your birth time on the clock is not your birth time in the sky.**

If you were born in Tokyo at 12:00 PM, the sun was not actually at its highest point above your head. Depending on the date and your exact location, the actual solar moment can differ from clock time by **roughly 20 to 30 minutes**.

In Korean Four Pillars astrology (Saju, 사주), this gap matters. A lot.

This is True Solar Time correction — a fundamental requirement of the classical Saju canon that most modern astrology apps quietly skip. Here's why it matters, what the math looks like, and why ignoring it can land you in the wrong birth chart entirely.

---

## What Is True Solar Time?

**Clock time** (the time on your phone) is **standard time** — a single time zone applied uniformly across a region. Japan uses JST (UTC+9). Korea uses KST (UTC+9). The entire United States, despite spanning thousands of kilometers, uses just four time zones.

**True Solar Time** is when the sun is actually at its highest point above your specific longitude. It's astronomical reality, not bureaucratic convenience.

The gap between them comes from two factors:

### 1. Longitude Offset

Standard time is calibrated to a single meridian. Tokyo (139.7°E) sits close to but east of the JST reference meridian (135°E), so solar noon in Tokyo arrives roughly **19 minutes earlier** than the clock says.

Seoul (126.9°E) is significantly west of the KST reference meridian — solar noon arrives roughly **32 minutes later** than the 12:00 PM clock reading.

### 2. Equation of Time

Earth's orbit is elliptical, not circular. Its rotation axis is tilted. These two facts mean the sun doesn't return to the same point in the sky every 24 hours exactly — it varies by up to **±16 minutes** depending on the time of year.

Combine longitude offset + equation of time, and you get the True Solar Time correction.

---

## Why This Matters in Saju (Four Pillars)

Saju assigns each person an **Hour Pillar** (時柱) — one of 12 two-hour blocks based on the sun's position at birth. The blocks are:

| Block | Standard Range |
|---|---|
| 子 (Rat) | 23:00 – 01:00 |
| 丑 (Ox) | 01:00 – 03:00 |
| 寅 (Tiger) | 03:00 – 05:00 |
| 卯 (Rabbit) | 05:00 – 07:00 |
| 辰 (Dragon) | 07:00 – 09:00 |
| 巳 (Snake) | 09:00 – 11:00 |
| 午 (Horse) | 11:00 – 13:00 |
| 未 (Goat) | 13:00 – 15:00 |
| 申 (Monkey) | 15:00 – 17:00 |
| 酉 (Rooster) | 17:00 – 19:00 |
| 戌 (Dog) | 19:00 – 21:00 |
| 亥 (Pig) | 21:00 – 23:00 |

If your birth time falls **near the boundary** of two blocks — say, 06:50 AM or 12:55 PM — a 20-30 minute correction can push you from one block into the next.

Different hour pillar = different Day Master interaction = different Five Elements balance = **a meaningfully different reading**.

---

## A Real Example: Born at 06:55 AM in Seoul

Consider someone born in Seoul at 06:55 AM. Seoul sits at 126.9°E — significantly west of the KST reference meridian at 135°E.

### Without True Solar Time correction:
- **Clock time: 06:55** falls within **Rabbit hour (卯, 05:00–07:00)** — barely
- Hour Pillar calculation uses Rabbit hour

### With True Solar Time correction:
- Longitude offset: roughly +30 minutes
- **Corrected solar time: roughly 07:25**
- Now falls within **Dragon hour (辰, 07:00–09:00)**
- Hour Pillar calculation uses Dragon hour entirely

**Same person. Same birth date. Same birth city. Two completely different Hour Pillars.**

The Rabbit hour and Dragon hour produce categorically different readings — different Ten Gods, different palace placements, different late-life patterns.

These are not subtle differences. They're meaningful errors that compound through every layer of the analysis.

---

## Why Most Saju Apps Skip This

We have surveyed the major Saju and Bazi apps available globally. To our knowledge, **most do not implement True Solar Time correction**. They feed the user's clock-time input directly into pillar calculation.

Why?

### 1. It's computationally non-trivial

You need:
- A geocoding service to convert birth city → longitude
- Astronomical lookup tables for the equation of time
- Date-aware calculations for daylight saving time and historical timezone changes

Most app developers treat the time field as a simple form input. They don't realize the classical canon explicitly requires this correction.

### 2. Users don't notice the error

If a user gets a Saju reading and it says "you're a Metal Dragon hour," they have no way to know the engine was supposed to give them an Earth Rabbit hour. The error is invisible.

### 3. The classical canon is rarely consulted

The requirement is documented in foundational Saju texts including 子平眞詮 and 命理正宗, both of which discuss longitudinal correction. Modern app builders rarely read the source material.

---

## The Five Foundational Texts and What They Say

Korean Saju draws from five major classical works:

| Text | Era | Key Contribution |
|---|---|---|
| 滴天髓 (Drop of Heaven's Marrow) | Ming Dynasty | Five Elements interaction theory |
| 窮通寶鑑 (Ultimate Profundity Treasure) | Ming Dynasty | Seasonal element adjustments |
| 子平眞詮 (Ziping's True Explanation) | Qing Dynasty | Day Master analysis framework |
| 命理正宗 (Orthodox Tradition of Fate) | Ming Dynasty | Pillar interaction patterns |
| 淵海子平 (Deep Sea Ziping) | Song Dynasty | Foundational Ziping methodology |

All five texts assume the practitioner is using true solar observation, not standard clock time. The latter didn't exist when these texts were written — standard time zones were a 19th-century invention.

When modern apps skip True Solar Time correction, they're effectively running classical canon through modern bureaucratic time. The result is **systematically inaccurate** by up to 30 minutes — enough to push many users into the wrong hour pillar entirely.

---

## How Precise Engines Handle This

A technically rigorous Saju engine performs the following:

1. **Geocode birth city** → latitude/longitude
2. **Determine historical timezone** for that location on that date (timezones have changed; e.g., Korea used different offsets in different decades)
3. **Apply daylight saving time** correction if applicable
4. **Calculate equation of time** for the specific date using astronomical tables
5. **Apply longitude offset** from the timezone meridian
6. **Use corrected time** for hour pillar calculation

This process happens in milliseconds in a well-designed engine. There's no excuse for skipping it in 2026.

---

## What This Means for Your Reading

If you've gotten a Saju reading from an app and the Hour Pillar feels "off" from the rest of your chart — it might not be your reading that's wrong. It might be the engine.

Ask yourself:

- Was your birth time near a two-hour block boundary (e.g., :50 to :10 of the next hour)?
- Were you born in a city far from your timezone's reference meridian (Tokyo, Seoul, San Francisco, Buenos Aires, Sydney all qualify)?
- Was your birth date in late spring or late autumn (when equation of time corrections are largest)?

If yes to any, your reading may have been calculated with the wrong hour pillar.

## Why We Built SajuAstrology Differently

SajuAstrology was built specifically to address the precision gap in modern astrology apps. Our engine implements:

- **Real-time RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) over **562 hand-curated passages** from the five foundational classical texts
- **Multi-LLM cross-validation** across Claude, GPT, and Gemini for every reading
- **True Solar Time correction** by birth-city longitude with full equation-of-time adjustment
- **Domain-specific AI companion** (Soram) with persistent memory

We treat Saju as what it historically is — a **5,000-year-old statistical pattern analysis system** with 518,400 unique birth pattern combinations. Closer to data science than divination.

Rimfactory, the team behind SajuAstrology, is a member of the **NVIDIA Inception Program**, classified as an **Astrotech AI Startup**. We focus on the engineering precision of pattern analysis, not on fortune-telling.
